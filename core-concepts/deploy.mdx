### User Commenting

When enabled before deployment, users can sign up on the public board and add comments to issues. This feature is useful for collecting feedback and tracking progress.

Project members can comment in either public or private mode. Private comments are visible only to project members, while public comments can be viewed on both internal and public boards.

### Upvotes and Downvotes

When enabled, users can upvote or downvote any issue on the deployed board. This helps project managers or owners prioritize which issues need attention.

### Issue Reactions

When this feature is enabled, users can react to issues on the public board using predefined emoticons. This provides a quick way for team members and the public to express their sentiments about specific issues, aiding in gauging overall opinion and urgency.

### Public Commenting and Private Commenting

This feature allows for both public and private comments on issues. Public comments can be seen by anyone who has access to the public board, offering a transparent way to gather community input. Private comments, on the other hand, are only visible to project members, allowing for internal discussions that are not disclosed to the public.

### Free Domain

Plane Deploy provides an option to host your public board on a free domain. This makes it even more accessible and straightforward for your audience to engage with your project. No additional setup or domain registration is required; simply choose this option during the publishing process, and your public board will be instantly accessible via the free domain.
