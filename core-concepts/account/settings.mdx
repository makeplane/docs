## Profile settings

Your profile includes details about you, primarily your name and display name, which are visible to others, especially in the assignee or creator sections of issues and other entities. You can update this information here.

Additionally, you have the option to deactivate your account, which removes you from all the workspaces you are associated with. However, please note that deactivating your account will not delete the issues or any other entities created by you.

## Preferences

You can customize how Plane looks or adjust the frequency of emails you receive from us via your preferences.

### Theme

- Background color: This sets the background color for all platform sections except the sidebar (such as dashboard, issues, pages, etc.).
- Text color: Determines the color of text across the platform, excluding the sidebar.
- Primary color: Defines the color of all call-to-action buttons and selections in the navigation.
