## Overview

Issue Types unlock a whole new way of adding, editing, and moving work forward in Plane. The default issue type called `Issue` is great for starting with Plane, but as you advance in your project management journey, you find the need for names and properties unique to the type of work you are doing.

For example, your Marketing team may need an issue type called `Content` with the properties, `Channel`, `SEO done?`, and `Reviewer` — properties that aren't available on the default Issues. Your Engineering team, on the other hand, may want an issue type called `Bugs` with the properties `Version` and `Environment` to have more upfront info per bug reported.

Issue Types make these and infinite other use cases possible.

## Use issue types

Once the project Admin sets up the issue types any project member can use them when creating issues or sub-issues.

- In the **Create new issue** modal, the user can choose the desired issue type from the list at the top left corner. By default, the issue type `Issue` is selected displaying both system-defined and custom properties.
- Changing the issue type will update the modal to display the relevant properties for that type.
- The system ensures that all properties marked as mandatory are filled before creating the issue.

When viewing issues, the issue type is displayed with an icon near the title for easy identification. Any custom properties added will also appear in the list of properties, and changes to these values are tracked in the issue's activity trail.
