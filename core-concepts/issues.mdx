title: Issues
---
Inside an issue, you can add as many details as you like to get your work done. Here are five critical things to kick-start:

1.  **Issue description**: An enhanced mardown editor inside issues to write as much detail you want. Attachments can be added and dragged around with a simple click, no need to save anything. Everything is auto-saved for you.
    
2.  **Issue sub-properties**: We support basic issue properties such as `priority`, `label`, `due date`, and `assignee`. You can create relations between issues: mark them as `blocked` or `blocking`.
    
3.  **Sub-issues**: You can create a `sub-issue` for an issue to either split the issue into smaller chunks, or assign parts of the issue to different people. If you find that a `sub-issue` is holding up the resolution of an issue, you can convert it to an issue so that it can be worked on separately.
    
4.  **Issue comments**: Think, comment or join the conversation by sharing your thoughts under Issue comments.
    
5.  **Issue activity**: Track what's happening to your issue with activities. Everything is saved, so you can look back and see what happened. Real-time coming soon!
    

### Issue views

You can organize project issues into views, which let you see your work through different filters or parameters. You can choose from default views that come with your project and workspace or create your own.

*   Every project has two primary views for issues - Board and List View.
*   You can quickly and easily organize the issues on your board by grouping them or ordering them within views.
*   You can toggle the visibility of issue sub-properties within views, at any time, based on your preferences.
