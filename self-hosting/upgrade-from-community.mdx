<Warning> 
 Follow the instructions below first all the way to the end of the section **Restore data**.  
 We strongly recommend you install on a fresh machine, not the one running Plane Community.
</Warning>

## Back up data
`setup.sh` in the Community Edition now comes with an option to back up your data.

1. Use  `./setup.sh` to open the operator menu and select `7` to backup your Plane data.
2. When done, your data will be backed up to the folder shown on the screen.
e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`
3. This folder will contain 3 `tar.gz` files.
    - `pgdata.tar.gz`
    - `redisdata.tar.gz`
    - `uploads.tar.gz`
4. Copy all the 3 files from the server running the Community Edition to any folder on the server running Plane One on any folder of your choice._createMdxContent

e.g., `~/ce-backup`

## Restore data
1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the folder with the back-up files.
    ```
    cd ~/ce-backup
    ```
2. Copy and paste the script below on Terminal and hit Enter.
    ```
    
    TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
    sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR
    for FILE in *.tar.gz; do
        if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
            tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
        else
            echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
            exit 1
        fi
    done

    mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
    mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
    mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
    mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
    ```
3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to /opt/plane/data.
4. Install **Commercial** edition.
