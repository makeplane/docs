This guide shows you the steps to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane using Kubernetes.

## Recommended edition
Plane One and Plane Pro are enabled on this edition, so the Free plan on this edition is easier to trial our paid plans from.

### Prerequisites

    - A working Kubernetes cluster
    - `kubectl` and `helm` on the client system that you will use to install our Helm charts

### Installation

    1. Open terminal or any other command-line app that has access to Kubernetes tools on your local system.
    2. Set the following environment variables:
        ```bash
        PLANE_VERSION=<v1.xx.x>
        ```
        ```bash
        DOMAIN_NAME=<subdomain.domain.tld or domain.tld>
        ```

    3. Add the Plane helm chart repo.

        ```bash
        helm repo add plane https://helm.plane.so/
        ```

    4. Use one of the following ways to deploy Plane:
        - **Quick setup**:  
        This is the fastest way to deploy Plane with the default settings. This will create stateful deployments for Postgres, Redis, and Minio with a persistent volume claim using the `longhorn` storage class. This also sets up the Ingress routes for you using `nginx` ingress class. To customize these settings, see the **Custom ingress routes** section on this page.

        Run the following command to deploy Plane:

            ```bash
                helm install plane-app plane/plane-enterprise \
                --create-namespace \
                --namespace plane \
                --set license.licenseDomain=${DOMAIN_NAME} \
                --set license.licenseServer=https://prime.plane.so \
                --set planeVersion=${PLANE_VERSION} \
                --set ingress.enabled=true \
                --set ingress.ingressClass=nginx \
                --set env.storageClass=longhorn \
                --timeout 10m \
                --wait \
                --wait-for-jobs
            ```

            <Note>
            This is the minimum required to set up Plane Commercial edition. You can change the default namespace from `plane`, the default app name from `plane-app`, the default storage class from `longhorn`, and the default ingress class from `nginx` to 
            whatever you would like to.<br/> <br/>
            You can also pass other settings referring to `Configuration Settings` section.
            </Note>

        - **Advanced setup**: 

            For more control over your setup, follow the steps below:
            
            1. Run the script below to download the `values.yaml` file and and edit using any editor like Vim or Nano. 

            ```bash
            helm  show values plane/plane-enterprise > values.yaml
            vi values.yaml
            ```

            Make sure you set the required environment variables listed below:
            - `planeVersion: <v1.xx.x>`
            - `license.licenseDomain: <The domain you have specified to host Plane>`
            - `license.licenseServer: https://prime.plane.so`
            - `ingress.enabled: <true | false>`
            - `ingress.ingressClass: <nginx or any other ingress class configured in your cluster>`
            - `env.storageClass: <longhorn or any other storage class configured in your cluster>`

            See the **Configuration settings** section for more details.

            2. After saving the `values.yaml` file, run the following command to deploy Plane:

            ```bash
                helm install plane-app plane/plane-enterprise \
                --create-namespace \
                --namespace plane \
                -f values.yaml \
                --timeout 10m \
                --wait \
                --wait-for-jobs 
            ```

    #### Ingress and SSL Setup

    | Setting | Default | Required | Description |
    |---|:---:|:---:|---|
    | ingress.enabled | true |  | Ingress setup in kubernetes is a common practice to expose the application to the intended audience.  Set it to `false` if you are using an external ingress providers like `Cloudflare` |
    | ingress.minioHost | 'plane-services.minio.example.com' |  | Based on the above configuration, if you want to expose the `minio` web console to a set of users, use this key to set the `host` mapping or leave it as `EMPTY` to not expose the interface. |
    | ingress.ingressClass | 'nginx' | Yes | Kubernetes cluster setup comes with various options of `ingressClass`. Based on your setup, set this value to the right one (eg. nginx, traefik, etc). Leave it to default in case you are using an external ingress provider.|
    | ingress.ingress_annotations | `{ "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size": "5m" }` |  | Ingress controllers come with various configuration options which can be passed as annotations. Setting this value lets you change the default value to user required. |
    | ssl.createIssuer | false |  | Kubernets cluster setup supports creating `issuer` type resource. After deployment, this is the step towards creating secure access to the ingress url. Issuer is required for you to generate SSL certificate. Kubernetes can be configured to use any certificate authority to generate SSL (depending on CertManager configuration). Set it to `true` to create the issuer. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true`|
    | ssl.issuer | http |  | CertManager configuration allows user to create issuers using `http` or any of the other DNS Providers like `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`, etc. As of now, Plane supports `http`, `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`|
    | ssl.token |  |  | To create issuers using DNS challenge, set the issuer api token of dns provider like cloudflare` or `digitalocean`(not required for http) |
    | ssl.server | `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` |  | Issuer creation configuration needs the certificate generation authority server url. Default URL is the `Let's Encrypt` server|
    | ssl.email | `plane@example.com` |  | Certificate generation authority needs a valid email id before generating certificate. Required when `ssl.createIssuer=true`  |
    | ssl.generateCerts | false |  | After creating the issuers, the user can still not create the certificate until sure of the configuration. Setting this to `true` will try to generate SSL certificate and associate with ingress. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true` and `ssl.createIssuer=true` |

    #### Common Environment Settings

    | Setting | Default | Required | Description |
    |---|:---:|:---:|---|
    | env.storageClass | longhorn |  | Creating the persitant volumes for the stateful deployments needs the `storageClass` name. Set the correct value as per your kubernetes cluster configuration. |
    | env.secret_key | 60gp0byfz2dvffa45cxl20p1scy9xbpf6d8c5y0geejgkyp1b5 | Yes | This must be a random string which is used for hashing/encrypting the sensitive data within the application. Once set, changing this might impact the already hashed/encrypted data|

## Community Edition

To install our Community Edition, please follow these steps below.

    ### Prerequisites

        - A working Kubernetes cluster
        - `kubectl` and `helm` on the client system that you will use to install our Helm charts

    ### Installation

        1. Open Terminal or any other command-line app that has access to Kubernetes tools on your local system.
        1. Add the Helm Repo

            ```bash
            helm repo add makeplane https://helm.plane.so/
            helm repo update
            ```

        1. Set-up and customization
            - Quick setup

                This is the fastest way to deploy Plane with default settings. This will create stateful deployments for Postgres, Redis, and Minio with a persistent volume claim using the `longhorn` storage class. This also sets up the ingress routes for you using `nginx` ingress class.

                <Tip> To customize this, see `Custom ingress routes` below. </Tip>

                Continue to be on the same Terminal window as you have so far, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

            ```bash
                helm install plane-app makeplane/plane-ce \
                    --create-namespace \
                    --namespace plane-ce \
                    --set planeVersion=stable \
                    --set ingress.appHost="plane.example.com" \
                    --set ingress.minioHost="plane-minio.example.com" \
                    --set ingress.ingressClass=nginx \
                    --set postgres.storageClass=longhorn \
                    --set redis.storageClass=longhorn \
                    --set minio.storageClass=longhorn \
                    --timeout 10m \
                    --wait \
                    --wait-for-jobs
                ```

                <Tip> 
                This is the minimum required to set up Plane-CE. You can change the default namespace from `plane-ce`, the default app name from `plane-app`, the default storage class from `[postgres, redis, minio].storageClass`, and the default ingress class from `ingress.ingressClass` to whatever you would like to.

                You can also pass other settings referring to `Configuration Settings` section.
                </Tip>
            - Advanced setup
            
                For more control over your set-up, run the script below to download the `values.yaml` file and and edit using any editor like Vim or Nano. 

                ```bash
                helm  show values makeplane/plane-ce > values.yaml
                vi values.yaml
                ```

                <Tip> See `Available customizations` for more details. </Tip>

                After saving the `values.yaml` file, continue to be on the same Terminal window as on the previous steps, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

                ```bash
                helm install plane-app makeplane/plane-ce \
                    --create-namespace \
                    --namespace plane-ce \
                    -f values.yaml \
                    --timeout 10m \
                    --wait \
                    --wait-for-jobs 
                ```

        | Setting | Default | Required | Description |
        |---|:---:|:---:|---|
        | ingress.enabled | true |  | Ingress setup in kubernetes is a common practice to expose the application to the intended audience.  Set it to `false` if you are using an external ingress providers like `Cloudflare` |
        | ingress.appHost | 'plane.example.com' | Yes | The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in the format `sudomain.domain.tld` or `domain.tld` that the license is bound to. It is also attached to your `ingress` host to access Plane. |
        | ingress.minioHost | 'plane-minio.example.com' |  | Based on the above configuration, if you want to expose the `minio` web console to set of users, use this key to set the `host` mapping or leave it as `EMPTY` to not expose the interface. |
        | ingress.ingressClass | 'nginx' | Yes | Kubernetes cluster setup comes with various options of `ingressClass`. Based on your setup, set this value to the right one (eg. nginx, traefik, etc). Leave it to default in case you are using an external ingress provider.|
        | ingress.ingress_annotations | `{ "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size": "5m" }` |  | Ingress controllers come with various configuration options which can be passed as annotations. Setting this value lets you change the default value to user required. |
        | ssl.createIssuer | false |  | Kubernets cluster setup supports creating `issuer` type resource. After deployment, this is the step towards creating secure access to the ingress url. Issuer is required for you to generate the SSL certificate. Kubernetes can be configured to use any certificate authority to generate SSL (depending on CertManager configuration). Set it to `true` to create the issuer. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true`|
        | ssl.issuer | http |  | CertManager configuration allows user to create issuers using `http` or any of the other DNS Providers like `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`, etc. As of now, Plane supports `http`, `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`|
        | ssl.token |  |  | To create issuers using DNS challenge, set the issuer api token of dns provider like cloudflare` or `digitalocean`(not required for http) |
        | ssl.server | [https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory](https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory) |  | Issuer creation configuration needs the certificate generation authority server url. Default URL is the `Let's Encrypt` server|
        | ssl.email | `plane@example.com` |  | Certificate generation authority needs a valid email id before generating certificate. Required when `ssl.createIssuer=true`  |
        | ssl.generateCerts | false |  | After creating the issuers, the user can still not create the certificate until sure of the configuration. Setting this to `true` will try to generate SSL certificate and associate with ingress. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true` and `ssl.createIssuer=true` |

        #### Common Environment Settings

        | Setting | Default | Required | Description |
        |---|:---:|:---:|---|
        | env.secret_key | 60gp0byfz2dvffa45cxl20p1scy9xbpf6d8c5y0geejgkyp1b5 | Yes | This must be a random string that is used for hashing/encrypting the sensitive data within the application. Once set, changing this might impact the already hashed/encrypted data|
