This guide shows you the steps to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane using Docker.

## Recommended edition
Plane One and Plane Pro are enabled on this edition, so the Free plan on this edition is easier to trial our paid plans from.

### Prerequisites

   - A virtual or on-prem machine with atleast 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM
   - `x64` AKA `AMD 64` or `AArch 64` AKA `ARM 64` CPUs
   - Supported operating systems:
      - Ubuntu
      - Debian
      - CentOS
      - Amazon Linux 2 or Linux 2023

### Installation

   1. `ssh` into your machine as the root user (or user with sudo access) per the norms of your hosting provider.
   2. Run the command below:  
      ```
      curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/ | sh -
      ```
   3. Follow the instructions on the terminal. Hit `Enter` or `Return` to continue.
   4. Enter the domain name where you will access the Plane app in the format `domain.tld` or `subdomain.domain.tld`. If you are using a paid plan, the domain linked to the license can’t be changed later.
   5. Choose one of the options below:
      - **Express**: Plane installs with the default configurations.
      - **Advanced**: You can customize the database, Redis, storage  and other settings.
   6. The installation will take a few minutes to complete and you will see the message **Plane has successfully installed**. You can access the Plane application on the domain you provided during the installation. 
   7. If you want to upgrade to a paid plan, see [Plane upgrades](/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan).

## Community Edition 
   To install our Community Edition, please follow these steps below.

   ### Prerequisites

   -   Docker installed and running. Choose one of the following options:
         - **Option 1**  
         Create an EC2 machine on AWS. It must of minimum **t3.medium/t3a.medium**. Run the below command to install docker engine.  
            ```bash 
            curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh -
            ```
         - **Option 2**  
         Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
   -   OS with bash scripting enabled (Ubuntu, Linux AMI, macos). Windows systems need to have [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   -   User context used must have access to docker services. In most cases, use `sudo su` to switch as root user.
   -   Use the terminal (or gitbash) window to run all the future steps.

   ### Installation
      1. Create a folder named `plane-selfhost` on your machine for deployment and data storage. 
            
         ```bash 
         mkdir plane-selfhost
         ```
      2. Navigate to this folder using the cd command.
         ```bash 
         cd plane-selfhost
         ```
      3. Download the latest stable release.
         ```bash 
         curl -fsSL -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/install.sh
         ```
            
         <Note>
         If you want to download the latest preview release, run the following commands:
            ```bash
            export RELEASE=preview
            ```
            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/$RELEASE/deploy/selfhost/install.sh | sed  's@BRANCH=master@BRANCH='"$RELEASE"'@' > setup.sh
            ```
            </Note>
      4. Make the file executable.
         ```bash
         chmod +x setup.sh
         ```
      5. Run the following command:
         ```bash
         ./setup.sh
         ```
         This will prompt you with the below options.
         ```list
         Select a Action you want to perform:
            1) Install (arm64)
            2) Start
            3) Stop
            4) Restart
            5) Upgrade
            6) View Logs
            7) Backup Data
            8) Exit
         Action [2]: 1
         ```
      6. Enter `1` as input. 
         This will create a folder `plane-app` or `plane-app-preview` (in case of preview deployment) and will download the `docker-compose.yaml` and `plane.env` files.
      7. Enter `8` to exit.
      8. Set up the environment variables. You can use any text editor to edit this file. Below are the most importants keys you must refer to:
         - `NGINX_PORT`: This is set to `80` by default. Make sure the port you choose to use is not preoccupied. For example, `NGINX_PORT=8080`
         - `WEB_URL`: This is set to `http://localhost` by default. Change this to the FQDN you plan to use along with NGINX\_PORT. For example,  `https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.
         - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: This is set to `http://localhost` by default. Change this to the FQDN you plan to use along with NGINX\_PORT. For example, `https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.
      9. Run the following command to continue with the setup.
         ```bash
         ./setup.sh
         ```
      10. Enter `2` as input to start the services.
         You will something like this:  
            ![Downloading docker images](/images/docker-compose/download-docker.png)
         Be patient as it might take some time based on your download speed and system configuration. If all goes well, you must see something like this:
            ![Downloading completed](/images/docker-compose/download-complete.png)
         This is the confirmation that all images were downloaded and the services are up and running.

      You have successfully self-hosted the Plane instance. Access the application by going to IP or domain you have configured it on. For example, `https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.

      #### Stop server

         In case you want to make changes to the environment variables in the `plane.env` file, we recommend that you stop the services before doing that.

         Run the `./setup.sh` command. Enter `3` to stop the services.

         If all goes well, you will see something like this:

         ![Stop Services](/images/docker-compose/stopped-docker.png)

      #### Restart server

         In case you want to make changes to `plane.env` variables without stopping the server or noticed some abnormalities in services, you can restart the services.

         Run the `./setup.sh` command. Enter `4` to restart the services.

         If all goes well, you will see something like this:
         ![Restart Services](/images/docker-compose/restart-docker.png)
