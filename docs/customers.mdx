The Customers feature transforms how you organize and prioritize work by placing your clients at the center of your process. Instead of managing tasks in isolation, Customers creates direct connections between your work items and the people they serve, helping teams make better decisions about what to prioritize and ensuring customer requests receive proper attention.

With Customers, you can create comprehensive client profiles, track specific requests, link those requests to your work items, and maintain important context about why certain work matters throughout your organization.
