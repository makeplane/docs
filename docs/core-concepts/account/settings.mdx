# Customize your account and preferences

Your account settings offer the ability to adjust your profile details, password, theme preferences, and email notification settings. Additionally, you can access a comprehensive list of all activities across workspaces.

Access your account settings from the side-navigation bar by clicking on your name/profile picture and selecting **Settings**.

## Profile

Your profile includes details about you, primarily your name and display name, which are visible to others, especially in the assignee or creator sections of work items and other entities. You can update this information here.

Additionally, you have the option to deactivate your account, which removes you from all the workspaces you are associated with. However, please note that deactivating your account will not delete the work items or any other entities created by you.

## Preferences

### Theme

By default, the theme on Plane is light. You have the option to synchronize it with your system's preference, select from a range of themes provided by us, or create a custom theme that reflects your personality.

To create your custom theme, you can specify the following:

- Background color: This sets the background color for all platform sections except the sidebar (such as dashboard, work items, pages, etc.).
- Text color: Determines the color of text across the platform, excluding the sidebar.
- Primary color: Defines the color of all call-to-action buttons and selections in the navigation.
- Sidebar background color: Sets the background color of the side navigation bar.
- Sidebar text color: Specifies the color of text displayed on the side navigation bar.

### First day of the week
Make your calendar feel just right by choosing which day kicks off your week. Whether you're team Sunday (traditional calendar style) or prefer Monday (workweek vibes), this setting ensures all calendars throughout the app match your personal preference.

Once you set this up in your preferences, every calendar view - from project timelines to due date pickers - will automatically align with your chosen week structure. It's one of those small touches that makes the whole experience feel more natural to how you think about time.

### Smooth cursor
If you love that buttery-smooth feel when moving your cursor around, toggle on the smooth cursor option. This feature adds a subtle animation to your cursor movement, creating a more fluid and responsive experience as you navigate through editors and interface elements.

Some people find it makes the app feel more polished and easier on the eyes, especially during longer editing sessions. Give it a try and see if the smoother motion feels right for your workflow - you can always toggle it off if you prefer the snappier default cursor behavior.

### Timezone and language

You can now customize your timezone and language preferences. The timezone setting controls how times are displayed across the platform, including notifications, activity logs, start and end dates, etc. Currently, we support English, French, Spanish, and Japanese, with more languages coming soon.

## Notifications

By default, email-based notifications are disabled for new users. You have the option to turn on all notifications or select specific types of notifications. Once you save your preferences, you will only receive email notifications for work items that match the preferences you have selected.

Notifications include updates on work items you've created, are assigned to, or have subscribed to. These notifications can also be found in the Inbox section on your sidebar. They encompass:

- Changes in work item state or properties made by others
- Mentions of you on work items
- Comments added to work items
- Work items created and assigned to you
