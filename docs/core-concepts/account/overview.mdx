The Dashboards in Plane is your central hub for staying organized and tracking progress within your workspace. It provides a comprehensive view of your work, recent activities, and team collaborationsâ€”all in one place.

## Home

Once logged in and within a workspace, the home page reflects your involvement in issues - those assigned to you, created by you, and completed by you. You can readily identify both due and overdue issues. Additionally, you have the option to view issues assigned to you categorized by their state and priority. Your recent activities, projects, and collaborators are also easily accessible on the home page.

## Your work

Your workspace profile consolidates information regarding your individual work and progress. It includes your workload, activity log, and a breakdown of issues by status and priority. Additionally, you'll find a list of all the issues assigned to you, created by you, and explicitly subscribed.
