Inside a work item, you can add as many details as you like to get your work done. Here are five critical things to kick-start:

1.  **Work item description**: An enhanced markdown editor inside work items to write as much detail you want. Attachments can be added and dragged around with a simple click, no need to save anything. Everything is auto-saved for you.
2.  **Work item sub-properties**: We support basic work item properties such as `priority`, `label`, `due date`, and `assignee`. You can create relations between work items: mark them as `blocked` or `blocking`.
3.  **Sub-work items**: You can create a `sub-work item` for a work item to either split the work item into smaller chunks, or assign parts of the work item to different people. If you find that a `sub-work item` is holding up the resolution of a work item, you can convert it to a work item so that it can be worked on separately.
4.  **Work item comments**: Think, comment or join the conversation by sharing your thoughts under Work item comments.
5.  **Work item activity**: Track what's happening to your work item with activities. Everything is saved, so you can look back and see what happened. Real-time coming soon!

### Work item views

You can organize project work items into views, which let you see your work through different filters or parameters. You can choose from default views that come with your project and workspace or create your own.

- Every project has two primary views for work items - Board and List View.
- You can quickly and easily organize the work items on your board by grouping them or ordering them within views.
- You can toggle the visibility of work item sub-properties within views, at any time, based on your preferences.
