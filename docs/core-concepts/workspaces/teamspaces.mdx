With Teamspaces, you can mirror your real-world teams of any kind and track work separately from a project. Link projects, see your team's work automatically filtered across projects, and house your team's knowledge separate from anything else in Plane.

## What is Teamspaces?

Teamspaces brings together people and projects in a neat space tucked away from all else in Plane, offering you an overview of your teams' work. Track issues across projects, manage multiple cycles, share views and pages, and chat with team members—all without jumping around from one screen to another.

## Team Overview

When you click on a Team, you'll see a comprehensive dashboard that gives you visibility into all activities across your team's projects. The **Jump in** section serves as your navigation hub, providing quick access to your team's Projects, Issues, Cycles, Views and Pages.  

### Team Projects

The Projects screen displays all projects associated with your team. 

![Team projects](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-projects.webp#center)

Here's what you can do:

- See each project's current state. 
    :::tip
    You need to turn on [Project States](/core-concepts/projects/project-states) for the projects to be displayed grouped by their State. Otherwise, the projects will appear as cards in a Gallery view.
    :::
- Use **Filters** to narrow down projects based on specific criteria.
- Customize the display layout to your preference using the **Display** dropdown.
- Navigate directly to a project's Issues screen by clicking on any project.

### Team Issues

The Issues screen lets you track all issues across your team's projects through two distinct tabs.

![Team issues](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-issues.webp#center)

**Team tab**  
- Shows issues assigned specifically to your team members.
- Helps track what your team is working on.

**Project tab**  
- Displays all issues from projects linked to your team.
- Provides a complete view of project-wide issues.

Each tab offers a different perspective on your work, helping you manage both team responsibilities and project progress effectively.

### Team Cycles

![Team cycles](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-cycles.webp#center)

You can track:

This consolidated view helps you monitor project timelines and track delivery schedules across all team projects.

### Team Views

The Views screen offers two ways to organize and access your team's work:

## Team progress

This section provides a visual representation and summary of the team's current workload and performance, helping managers track progress effectively. It highlights overdue issues, incomplete tasks, and pending actions, ensuring teams stay on top of their responsibilities. 

![Team progress](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-progress.webp#center)

Here's a breakdown of its components:

- **Overdue Issues**  
A red-highlighted banner at the top shows the count of overdue issues, emphasizing the urgency to address them.
This feature encourages timely action to meet deadlines and reduce project delays.

- **Progress chart**  
A bar chart displays the progress of issues categorized by selected criteria, such as Priority, Due Date, or Start Date.
Users can toggle between these views using the dropdown menu to focus on specific aspects of the team's work.
Each bar is segmented to show the percentage of completed and pending issues, offering a quick comparison.

- **Summary of Team's Issues**  
A summary panel on the right provides a detailed breakdown of issue states:
  - Displays counts for Pending and Completed issues.
  - Includes additional states like Backlog and Cancelled, ensuring all issues are accounted for.

  It also highlights issues without due dates, helping team leads prioritize and assign deadlines.

## Team Relations
The Relations feature allows team members to track dependencies between issues. It has two main tabs: Blocking and Blocked.

![Team relations](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-relations.webp#center)

**Blocking**  
This tab displays issues that are currently blocking other tasks, potentially causing delays in your team’s workflow.

**Blocked**  
This tab would display issues that are blocked by others. It helps in identifying bottlenecks and ensuring timely resolution to keep tasks moving.

## Team stats
This section provides a high-level view of tasks across multiple projects or teams. It visualizes issues in a treemap format, where each section represents a project, and the size of each block is proportional to the number of issues.

![Team stats](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-stats.webp#center)

You can group the stats based on filters like Projects, Members, State Groups, Dependency, and Due By to focus on specific areas of work.

A legend at the bottom categorizes issues by their state or priority, making it easier to understand their progress. 

This feature helps you quickly assess the distribution of workload, identify where resources are focused, and monitor the health of ongoing efforts.

## Teams info

The Info tab on the right serves as a centralized space to view key details and linked entities.

![Teams info](https://media.docs.plane.so/teams/team-info.webp#center)

Displays primary details about the entity. For example, the lead or owner of the team is listed here.

- **Team's entities**
