Think of a Workspace in Plane as your command center, the place where everything comes together. It’s the top-level space that holds all your projects, work items, cycles, modules, and pages.

Picture it like this. A Workspace in Plane is similar to a server in Discord or an organization in Slack. It’s where your team gathers to work on projects, track progress, and get things done. You can create your own projects, invite others to join, and collaborate as a group, or just do your own thing if that’s how you roll.

## What's inside a workspace

Every workspace in Plane has two main components:

- **Projects**  
  Projects serve as the cornerstone for all activities within the product. You can create work items, assign tasks to members, and track progress for whatever you’re working on. If you envision your organization as NASA, each mission can be likened to a project. [Learn more here](/core-concepts/projects/overview).
- **Members**  
  Invite your teammates, collaborators, or managers to join your workspace. Each user gets a role, like Admin, Member, or Guest, to control what they can do. [Explore roles here](/core-concepts/workspaces/members).

## Create workspace

If you belong to multiple workspaces:

1. Click your current workspace name in the top-left corner.

All your workspaces must be associated with the same email address.
