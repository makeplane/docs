# Manage users

Keeping your workspace organized and secure is essential for smooth project management. Plane makes it easy to control who can access your workspace, what they can do, and how they collaborate with others. This guide will walk you through managing members and assigning roles.


You can manage the members in your workspace by navigating to **Workspace settings > Members**.

### Add member

![Invite user](https://media.docs.plane.so/workspaces/add-user.webp#center)

1. Click on **Add member**. This opens a modal where you can:
   1. Enter the email addresses of the user you’re inviting.
   2. Assign the role to **Admin**, **Member**, or **Guest**.
   3. Click **Add another** to add multiple users.
   4. Finally, click the **Invite** button.

Once invited, members receive an email notification.
:::caution[Self-hosted users]
Ensure your SMTP server is properly configured to send invite emails successfully. See [Email](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/communication) for more information.

After the user accepts the invitation, they’ll be added to the workspace. If they don’t accept or decline, you can manually remove the pending invitation.

### Update member roles

![Update user role](https://media.docs.plane.so/workspaces/update-user.webp#center)

1. Locate the member whose role you want to update.
2. Use the role dropdown to promote or demote their role.

Admins can update any member's role, while regular members can only promote others to the Member role.

### Remove member

![Remove user](https://media.docs.plane.so/workspaces/remove-user.webp#center)

1. Find the member you want to remove.
2. Click the **Remove** option next to their name.

Once removed, they’ll immediately lose access to the workspace and its projects.
