# Manage members

Keeping your workspace organized and secure is essential for smooth project management. Plane makes it easy to control who can access your workspace, what they can do, and how they collaborate with others. 

This guide shows you how to add members to your workspace, change their roles, and remove them when needed.

## Invite a member to your workspace
![Invite user](https://media.docs.plane.so/workspaces/add-user.webp#center)

1. Navigate to **Workspace settings > Members**.
2. Click **Add member**.
3. In the modal:
   - Enter the email address of the person you're inviting.
   - Select their role: **Admin**, **Member**, or **Guest**.
   - To invite multiple people at once, click **Add another** and repeat.
4. Click **Invite**.

The invited person receives an email notification with instructions to join your workspace.

**If the invitation isn't accepted:**
- The invitation remains pending until accepted or declined.
- You can manually remove pending invitations using the Remove option (see below).
