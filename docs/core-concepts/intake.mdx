# Triage work items before adding them to your project

Intake is a Plane-only feature that lets `Guests` create work items following which `Admins` and `Members` can move these work items inside a project. Intake can take bug reports, feature or service requests, or raise a ticket by stakeholders, customers, or clients. Work items created in Intake can then be accepted to move them to the Projectâ€™s workflow. 

## Turn on Intake

Intake functions at the project level and is toggled off by default. Project `Admins` can turn on the Intake feature for the project. 

1. Click the three-dots icon next to your project name on the left pane and click **Settings**.
2. Select **Features** on the right pane.
3. Switch on the toggle button for the **Intake** feature to turn it on for the project.

### Properties

A `Guest` role can assign properties when creating an Intake work item. However, these properties can be overridden by the project `Admin` or `Member` later.

For a work item in the Intake, you can choose to assign the following properties:

| Property      | Description         |
| --------------| ------------------- |
| State         | If the work item in Intake is still being triaged, you can assign it to a state to help you identify the progress before moving it to your project.
| Priority      | Set the priority of the work item to align the expectations on how quickly the work item should be acted upon.
| Assignees     | Assign the team member who should triage or prioritize the work item.
| Labels        | Categorize work items using the labels available in the project.
| Due date     | Set when the work item needs to be prioritized or triaged by adding a due date.

## Intake work item actions

When a Guest creates a work item in Intake, it is added to the `Pending` state. Admin and Member roles can accept, decline, snooze or mark the work item as a duplicate.

### Accept work item

    ![accept-intake-work item](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/accept-intake-issue.webp#center)
    
1. Open a pending work item in Intake.
2. Click the **Accept** button on the top right. This will open a modal where you can change the work item details before moving it to your project.
3. Click the **Add to project** button to move the work item from **Intake** to **Work items** under the project. The work item will be visible under the **State** selected when creating or accepting the Intake work item.

### Decline work item
    
If the work item is not relevant to your project, you can choose to decline it. Click the **Decline** button present on any pending work item to decline it. Once the work item is declined, it ends up in the `Cancelled` state under your project.
   
### Snooze work item
    
An work item can be snoozed to review it at a later time.

    ![snooze-intake-work item](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/snooze-intake-issue.webp#center)
    
1. Open a pending work item in Intake.
2. Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner.
3. Select the **Snooze** option in the menu.
4. Select a date to review it later.
    
The work item is moved out of pending Intake work items and can be accessed in the **Filters** drop-down under `Open` work items. You can also un-snooze the work item from the three dots menu. 

### Mark work item as duplicate
    
In cases where a similar work item exists in your project, an Intake work item can be marked as duplicate. 
    
1. Open a pending work item in Intake.
2. Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner.
3. Select the **Mark as duplicate** option in the menu.
4. Select a work item in the project that is a duplicate of the Intake work item.

    ![mark-duplicate-intake-work items](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/mark-duplicate-intake-issues.webp#center)
    
The work item is now declined with a â€˜Duplicateâ€™ label on it. It will also appear in the `Cancelled` state under your project.

### Delete Intake work item

Only `Admins` have permission to delete Intake work items before it goes through the workflow. Deleted work items will not appear under any label in the `Closed` work items of Intake.
   
## View Intake work items

You can view **Open** and **Closed** work items in Intake by clicking on the appropriate tabs. The description editor also shows the last edited timestamp and the person who made the edit.

`Pending` or `Snoozed` work items are considered open work items. Further action can take place on such work items. Whereas, `Accepted`, `Declined`, and `Duplicate` appear under closed work items. No further action is required on closed work items.

### Sort and filter

Like work items in the project, sorting and filtering can create a focused view of work items in Intake. Filters and sorting can be applied to a list of work items simultaneously. 

Filters can be assigned from the **Filters** dropdown available on the left-hand side of the Intake page. Work items can be filtered by *Work item status*, *State*, *Priority*, *Assignee*, *Created by*, *Labels*, *Created date*, and *Last updated date*.

Next to the Filters dropdown, you can use the sort drop-down to arrange Intake work items sequentially. Work items can be sorted by *Date created*, *Date updated*, and *ID* in ascending or descending order.
