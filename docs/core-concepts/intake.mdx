# Triage issues before adding them to your project

Intake is a Plane-only feature that lets `Guests` create issues following which `Admins` and `Members` can move these issues inside a project. Intake can take bug reports, feature or service requests, or raise a ticket by stakeholders, customers, or clients. Issues created in Intake can then be accepted to move them to the Projectâ€™s workflow. 

## Enable Intake

Intake functions at the project level and is toggled off by default. Project `Admins` can enable the Intake feature for the project. 

1. Click the three-dots icon next to your project name on the left pane and click **Settings**.
2. Select **Features** on the right pane.
3. Switch on the toggle button for the **Intake** feature to enable it on the project.

### Properties

A `Guest` role can assign properties when creating an Intake issue. However, these properties can be overridden by the project `Admin` or `Member` later.

For an issue in the Intake, you can choose to assign the following properties:

| Property      | Description         |
| --------------| ------------------- |
| State         | If the issue in Intake is still being triaged, you can assign it to a state to help you identify the progress before moving it to your project.
| Priority      | Set the priority of the issue to align the expectations on how quickly the issue should be acted upon.
| Assignees     | Assign the team member who should triage or prioritize the issue.
| Labels        | Categorize issues using the labels available in the project.
| Due date     | Set when the issue needs to be prioritized or triaged by adding a due date.

## Intake issue actions

When a Guest creates an issue in Intake, it is added to the `Pending` state. Admin and Member roles can accept, decline, snooze or mark the issue as a duplicate.

### Accept issue

    ![accept-intake-issue](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/accept-intake-issue.webp#center)
    
1. Open a pending issue in Intake.
2. Click the **Accept** button on the top right. This will open a modal where you can change the issue details before moving it to your project.
3. Click the **Add to project** button to move the issue from **Intake** to **Issues** under the project. The issue will be visible under the **State** selected when creating or accepting the Intake issue.

### Decline issue
    
If the issue is not relevant to your project, you can choose to decline it. Click the **Decline** button present on any pending issue to decline it. Once the issue is declined, it ends up in the `Cancelled` state under your project.
   
### Snooze issue
    
An issue can be snoozed to review it at a later time.

    ![snooze-intake-issue](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/snooze-intake-issue.webp#center)
    
1. Open a pending issue in Intake.
2. Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner.
3. Select the **Snooze** option in the menu.
4. Select a date to review it later.
    
The issue is moved out of pending Intake issues and can be accessed in the **Filters** drop-down under `Open` issues. You can also un-snooze the issue from the three dots menu. 

### Mark issue as duplicate
    
In cases where a similar issue exists in your project, an Intake issue can be marked as duplicate. 
    
1. Open a pending issue in Intake.
2. Click on the three dots icon in the top right corner.
3. Select the **Mark as duplicate** option in the menu.
4. Select an issue in the project that is a duplicate of the Intake issue.

    ![mark-duplicate-intake-issues](https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/mark-duplicate-intake-issues.webp#center)
    
The issue is now declined with a â€˜Duplicateâ€™ label on it. It will also appear in the `Cancelled` state under your project.

### Delete issue

Only `Admins` have permission to delete Intake issues before it goes through the workflow. Deleted issues will not appear under any label in the `Closed` issues of Intake.
   
## View Intake issues

You can view **Open** and **Closed** issues in Intake by clicking on the appropriate tabs.

    <img src="https://media.docs.plane.so/intake/intake-tabs.webp#center" />

`Pending` or `Snoozed` issues are considered open issues. Further action can take place on such issues. Whereas, `Accepted`, `Declined`, and `Duplicate` appear under closed issues. No further action is required on closed issues.

### Sort and filter

Like issues in the project, sorting and filtering can create a focused view of issues in Intake. Filters and sorting can be applied to a list of issues simultaneously. 

Filters can be assigned from the **Filters** dropdown available on the left-hand side of the Intake page. Issues can be filtered by *Issue status*, *State*, *Priority*, *Assignee*, *Created by*, *Labels*, *Created date*, and *Last updated date*.

Next to the Filters dropdown, you can use the sort drop-down to arrange Intake issues sequentially. Issues can be sorted by *Date created*, *Date updated*, and *ID* in ascending or descending order.
