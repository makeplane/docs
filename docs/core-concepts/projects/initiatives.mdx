## Track Epics across projects

    ![Add Epics](https://media.docs.plane.so/initiatives/add-epics.webp#center)

With Initiatives, you can bring together Epics from different projects into a single, high-level view. This helps you track progress across multiple workstreams in one place, giving you a clear picture of how everything is moving forward.

Here’s how it helps:

- Group related Epics from different projects under one Initiative to keep everything connected.
- Get a centralized view of progress, dependencies, and blockers across multiple projects.
- No more jumping between projects—track and manage Epics in one place.

After you create an Initiative and add Epics from any project. From there, you can monitor overall progress, update statuses, and ensure everything stays on track.

This is perfect for cross-functional teams working on company-wide objectives, product launches, or any effort that spans multiple projects.

## Initiative updates

    ![Initiative updates](https://media.docs.plane.so/initiatives/initiative-updates.webp#center)

The Initiative updates stream displays all project and epic updates in a chronological feed at the top of the Initiative view. Each update card shows:

- Status indicators (On Track, At Risk, Off Track)
- Source project or epic name
- Post date and author
- Complete update content

This consolidated view enables Initiative owners to monitor progress across all connected work without navigating to individual items. The stream combines qualitative context with the initiative's quantitative metrics, providing real-time visibility into progress and potential risks across all contributing workstreams.

## Properties, comments, and activity

- The Info tab on the side panel of an Initiative provides a quick snapshot of key properties and metadata associated with the Initiative.

## Sort and filter Initiatives

To make managing Initiatives easier, Plane provides options to filter and sort them based on various criteria:

**Filter Initiatives**:

- By the assigned lead with options to select multiple leads or search for a specific person.
- Based on their start date. Quick options include "1 week from now," "2 weeks from now," "1 month from now," and a custom date selector.
- Based on their target completion date, similar to the start date options.

**Sort Initiatives**: 

- **Group By**  
  Organize your Initiatives by categories like Lead or Created By. You can also choose "None" to view Initiatives in a flat list.
- **Order By**  
  Sort Initiatives manually, by the last created date, or by the last updated date to prioritize the most relevant ones.

These filtering and sorting tools make it easier to focus on specific Initiatives or prioritize your view based on team needs.
