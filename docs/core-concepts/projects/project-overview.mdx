Without a centralized project view, teams often face challenges like fragmented information, inefficient progress tracking, and communication gaps. 

Project Overview offers a centralized space for teams to monitor project health, track progress, and collaborate effectively. It consolidates key project metrics, updates, and collaboration tools into a single view. Whether you're a project lead, team member, or stakeholder, this feature provides the visibility you need to stay informed and aligned.

## Access project overview

Navigate to **Issues** under your project and click **Overview** on the top bar. Alternatively, click the project name at the top left when working within other sections like Cycles or Pages.

## Project header

The header includes the project details and quick access to essential actions.

- Add a custom banner and project icon to personalize your dashboard.
- Write key details about your project plan, goals, and success metrics, helping your team stay aligned and focused.
- Attach links or resources directly to the dashboard.
