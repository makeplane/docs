Without a centralized dashboard, teams often face challenges like fragmented information, inefficient progress tracking, and communication gaps. 

Project Overview offers a centralized space for teams to monitor project health, track progress, and collaborate effectively. It consolidates key project metrics, updates, and collaboration tools into a single view. Whether you're a project lead, team member, or stakeholder, this feature provides the visibility you need to stay informed and aligned.

## Access Project Overview

Navigate to **Issues** under your project and click **Overview** on the top bar.

## Project header

The header includes the project details and quick access to essential actions.

- Add a custom banner and project icon to personalize your dashboard.
- Write key details about your project plan, goals, and success metrics, helping your team stay aligned and focused.
- Attach links or resources directly to the dashboard.

## Project metrics
You can view overall project completion percentages. Metrics are displayed visually with status bars to help identify bottlenecks.
This helps to identify overdue tasks and track progress over time. Task status breakdown:
- **Overdue**: Tasks past their due dates.
- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not yet prioritized.
- **Unstarted**: Tasks yet to begin.
- **Started**: Tasks currently in progress.
- **Completed**: Tasks that are done.
