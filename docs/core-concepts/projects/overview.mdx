Projects let you manage teams and tasks within your Workspace. After creating your [**Workspace**](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview.mdx), you will need to create a new project.

## Create a project

To create a new project in your workspace, you can press `P` or navigate to the Projects tab in your workspace and click on "+ New project".

When creating a project, you need to specify the following project attributes:

- **Name**: The name of the project.
- **Identifier**: Attached to every issue in the project to track and differentiate them across projects and the workspace. You can update the identifier, which replaces the ID string on the issue.
- **Access**: Set to either Private or Public. When made public, all workspace users can join the project. When set to private, admins need to invite workspace members to join.
- **Description (Optional)**: Add a description to help workspace members understand the project's purpose.
- **Lead (Optional)**: Identify whom to reach out to for queries related to the project's execution.

These options can be edited later under the General tab inside Project &gt; Settings.

## Configure project features

After creating a project, you can toggle specific features based on your requirements. Here are the features you can toggle:

- **Cycles**: Timebox issues in your project to build momentum.
- **Modules**: Group issues logically together. An issue can have multiple modules.
- **Views**: Analyze and investigate issues by adding filters and saving them as views.
- **Pages**: Document information, ideas, and guides related to your project.
- **Inbox**: Capture requests for your project and accept them to add to your workflow.

## Add and manage members

To add members to a project, they must first be part of the workspace. [Invite them to the workspace](/core-concepts/workspaces/members#adding-members).

For each member invited to the project, you can assign roles just like in the workspace. [Manage roles](/core-concepts/workspaces/members#workspace-roles) with options including Admin, Member, Guest, and Viewer. You can also update them later.

If you want every issue to be assigned, you can set a default assignee for times when an issue is created without any assignees.

## Remove project

You can delete a project to completely remove it. Once deleted, all corresponding issues, cycles, views, modules, and pages are also fully deleted. Currently, Plane doesn't provide a way to recover a deleted project.

:::note
Soon, we'll introduce a feature to archive projects, enabling you to hide projects that are not in focus from your navigation bar.
