# Add and manage members

To add members directly to your project, they first need to be part of your workspace. [Invite them](/core-concepts/workspaces/members#add-member) to the workspace if they're not already there.

Once they're in the workspace, you can invite them to join the project and assign roles like **Admin**, **Member**, or **Guest**. You can always update their roles later if needed.

If you want to make sure every work item gets assigned, you can set a **Default assignee** for when work items are created without one. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

### How users join projects

Users can become project members in two different ways, and understanding both helps you manage your project team effectively.

**Direct project membership** is where you specifically invite users to your project and assign them roles. These members have access only to the projects you've added them to, and you have full control over their permissions.

**Teamspace-based membership** happens automatically when your project is linked to a [Teamspace](/core-concepts/workspaces/teamspaces). All members of that teamspace automatically receive `Member` access to your project, making it perfect for teams that collaborate across multiple projects.

Users can have both types of access simultaneously. When this happens, Plane automatically applies whichever role gives them higher permissions. For example, if someone is a `Guest` on your project but joins a linked teamspace, they're automatically upgraded to `Member` access. If they're already an `Admin`, they keep their `Admin` role.


### Grant view access to Guests

You can turn on this setting in **Project Settings > Members**. Enabling this setting allows guest users to view all project work items, providing them with broader visibility into the project's progress and details. This is useful for external stakeholders who need full context without editing permissions.

The Guest view access toggle
By default, Guests can only interact with work items they're explicitly involved withâ€”a conservative security posture. However, some projects benefit from broader Guest visibility: client review projects, public roadmaps, or stakeholder dashboards.
The "Grant guest users view access" setting expands Guest permissions within a specific project, allowing them to view all work items rather than just their own. This setting is project-specific rather than workspace-wide, acknowledging that different projects have different confidentiality requirements.
Even with view access enabled, Guests remain limited to their invited projects and cannot see the broader workspace structure.
