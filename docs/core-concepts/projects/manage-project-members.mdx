# Add and manage members

To add members directly to your project, they first need to be part of your workspace. [Invite them](/core-concepts/workspaces/members#add-member) to the workspace if they're not already there.

Once they're in the workspace, you can invite them to join the project and assign roles like **Admin**, **Member**, or **Guest**. You can always update their roles later if needed.

If you want to make sure every work item gets assigned, you can set a **Default assignee** for when work items are created without one. This ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

### How users join projects

Users can become project members in two different ways, and understanding both helps you manage your project team effectively.

**Direct project membership** is where you specifically invite users to your project and assign them roles. These members have access only to the projects you've added them to, and you have full control over their permissions.

**Teamspace-based membership** happens automatically when your project is linked to a [Teamspace](/core-concepts/workspaces/teamspaces). All members of that teamspace automatically receive `Member` access to your project, making it perfect for teams that collaborate across multiple projects.

Users can have both types of access simultaneously. When this happens, Plane automatically applies whichever role gives them higher permissions. For example, if someone is a `Guest` on your project but joins a linked teamspace, they're automatically upgraded to `Member` access. If they're already an `Admin`, they keep their `Admin` role.
