Milestones provide a layer to align work items and epics toward shared completion dates, helping teams focus on strategic objectives and critical deliverables. Whether tracking quarterly goals, product launches, or major feature releases, milestones give you visibility into progress and ensure teams stay on track.

## Manage milestones

### Track progress

![Manage Milestones](https://media.docs.plane.so/milestones/manage-milestone.webp#hero)

Each milestone displays:

- Completion percentage: Based on linked work items and epics.
- Target date: Deadline with visual indicators for approaching or overdue milestones

Click on a milestone to expand and see all linked work items. The progress bar updates automatically as work items are completed or cancelled.

### View milestones in Timeline layout

Milestones appear as visual indicators in the Timeline layout, making it easy to see important deadlines alongside your work items.

- The vertical dashed line shows when the milestone is due.
- Hover over a milestone to see its name, progress percentage, and linked work item count.

This helps you quickly identify whether work is on track to meet milestone deadlines and spot potential scheduling conflicts.

### Link work items and epics

You can link work items and epics to milestones in two ways:

**From the milestone**  
Click **Link work items** and select work items and epics from your project.

**From the work item or epic**  
Open any work item or epic and assign it to a milestone from the properties panel.
