# Estimate effort for issues

Estimates in Plane help quantify the effort required for each issue in your project. Whether using a simple number scale or categories like T-shirt sizes, estimates provide a clearer idea of the work involved. They act as a proxy for complexity, helping teams gauge task scale quickly without detailed breakdowns. Estimates also aid in prioritizing, resource allocation, managing workload expectations, and identifying potential bottlenecks.

## Set up estimates

By default, your project won’t have an estimate system. To get started, go to the **Estimates** tab under **Project > Settings**.
Once there, click **Add estimate system** and you can choose from the following estimate systems:

### Points

This system uses numeric values to quantify effort, making it a great fit for teams that prefer to track progress based on numbers. Plane offers several preset progressions for you to choose from:

- **Linear**  
A simple, evenly spaced number progression.
- **Fibonacci**   
A more dynamic progression where each number is the sum of the previous two (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.). This is useful when estimating tasks of varying complexity.
- **Squares**  
A progression where each value is the square of the number (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.).
- **Custom**  
Create your own progression to match your team's specific needs.

### Category
        
If you prefer to estimate effort by text categories rather than numbers, this is the system for you. Typical examples include:

- **T-shirt sizes**  
A common approach to estimating effort, this system uses sizes like XS, S, M, L, and XL to represent the complexity or effort of an issue. This method is popular in agile teams for its simplicity.
- **Easy to Hard** 
This system uses categories like "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard" to represent how difficult or time-consuming an issue might be. It's useful when you want to quickly categorize tasks without needing exact numbers.
- **Custom**  
You can create your own custom categories to fit your team’s workflow. Whether you want to use something like "Low", "Medium", "High" or something more specific to your project, the custom option allows complete flexibility.

This system provides a high-level estimate of effort based on intuitive categories, which is especially helpful in teams where relative effort matters more than precise numeric estimates.
   

When you are done, you can enable estimates by clicking on **Create estimates**. You can also change the type of the system by clicking the pencil icon next to the system you have set.

:::note
In earlier versions of Plane, we allowed multiple estimate systems within a single project, giving you the ability to switch between them. Based on user feedback, we’ve simplified this process. Now, each project can only have one active estimate system, and older, inactive systems have been archived for better clarity and ease of use.
