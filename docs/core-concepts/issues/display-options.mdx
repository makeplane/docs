# Display options for issues

The Display dropdown in Plane gives you full control over how your issues are presented, grouped, and ordered. This flexibility ensures that you can tailor the layout to suit your workflow, whether you're a developer working through a backlog, a manager tracking priorities, or a QA engineer validating tasks. Let’s break down how you can make the most of this feature.

## Display properties

Depending on the type of [layout](/core-concepts/issues/layouts) you're working with, you can choose which properties are shown or hidden for each issue. To customize, simply select the properties in the dropdown. This lets you declutter your view by hiding irrelevant fields while surfacing the ones you care about.

Here’s the list of properties you can display in the layout:

- ID
- Issue Type
- Assignee
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Labels
- Priority 
- State
- Sub-issue Count
- Attachment Count
- Link
- Estimate
- Modules
- Cycle

## Group by

Grouping helps you organize issues based on shared attributes, making it easier to focus on specific workflows or priorities. You can group issues by:

- State
- Priority
- Cycle
- Module
- Labels
- Assignees
- Created By 

## Sub-group by

You can further refine your view by adding a sub-grouping. For example, you could group by State and then sub-group by Assignees to see the state of tasks per team member. Sub-grouping options include:

- Priority
- Cycle
- Module
- Labels
- Assignees
- Created By
- None

## Order by

Fine-tune the order of issues within groups to reflect your team’s priorities. Plane offers the following ordering options:

- Manual
- Last Created
- Last Updated
- Start Date
- Due Date
- Priority

## Additional options

### Show sub-issues
Expand main issues to display their sub-issues directly within the layout.

### Show empty groups
Decide whether groups with no issues are visible.
