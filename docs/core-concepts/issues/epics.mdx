Epics help you group related tasks into a larger work item, providing a hierarchical structure for managing complex projects. This feature is ideal for breaking down major objectives into smaller, manageable pieces while keeping everything organized within a project.

Use Epics when you need to:

- Organize tasks related to a larger objective or feature.
- Track progress and dependencies across multiple related work items.
- Improve visibility into how individual tasks contribute to broader goals.

:::tip
Use an Epic for larger bodies of work that span multiple cycles and extend across different modules.
