Epics help you group related tasks into a larger work item, providing a hierarchical structure for managing complex projects. This feature is ideal for breaking down major objectives into smaller, manageable pieces while keeping everything organized within a project.

Use Epics when you need to:

- Organize tasks related to a larger objective or feature.
- Track progress and dependencies across multiple related issues.
- Improve visibility into how individual tasks contribute to broader goals.

:::tip
Use an Epic for larger bodies of work that span multiple cycles and extend across different modules.

An issue can belong to only one Epic. This ensures clarity in organization and avoids overlapping tasks across multiple Epics.
