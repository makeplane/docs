# Organize issues with Labels

Labels are keywords or tags that you can assign to issues in order to categorize and differentiate them within your project. They are ideal for tracking components or other unique identifiers that don’t fall under the standard issue properties. 

Labels can be used to group issues by common attributes, such as type, feature, or any other custom classification. They make it easier to filter and find related issues across your project.

## Manage labels

You can manage your labels in the **Labels** tab in your project settings. From here, you can create, edit, and delete labels. 

### Create labels

To create a new label:

1. Click the **Add label** button.
2. Name your label, choose a color (optional)
3. Click **Add** to save your label.

### Edit labels

1. Click the … icon on the label you want to edit and select **Edit label**.
2. Update the label name or color as needed.
3. Click **Update** to save your changes.

### Delete labels

2. Click the **x** icon on the label to delete it.
