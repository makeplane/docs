# See, plan and track issues with Layouts

Plane offers five different ways to view and manage your issues, each designed to help your team work more effectively.

## List layout

The List layout shows all issues in a simple, ordered list. You can group issues by priority, assignee, or labels to see your work from different angles. It's straightforward and gives you a clear overview of everything happening in your project.

## Board layout

Think of the Board layout like a digital whiteboard. Issues are organized into columns (like Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done), making it easy to see where things stand. Just drag and drop issues between columns to update their status quickly.

## Calendar layout
The Calendar layout maps out your issues by their due dates. It's perfect for tracking deadlines and planning ahead. Whether you're mapping out a sprint or checking what's coming up, this view keeps your schedule in focus.

## Table layout
The Table layout is like a spreadsheet for your issues. Each row is an issue, with columns showing all the details. It's great when you need to make bulk changes or want to see every piece of information at once.

## Timeline layout
The Timeline layout (or Gantt chart) shows your project's progress over time. You can see how long tasks take, when they start and finish, and how they connect to each other. It's ideal for understanding the big picture of your project's workflow.
