# View your issues with Layouts

In Plane, layouts help you view and manage issues in different ways, making it easier to track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay organized. Each layout offers a unique way to visualize your project data, so you can choose the one that works best for your team's needs. Let’s take a look at the available layout options.

## List layout

The List layout displays issues as an ordered list, providing a simple and efficient way to view all issues. You can easily group issues by specific properties like priority, assignee, or labels to organize them into meaningful categories. This view is perfect for teams that need a straightforward, no-frills way of managing their issues while keeping an eye on important details.

## Board layout

The Board layout groups issues by a specific property, typically by issue states (e.g., Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, Cancelled). This view is ideal for teams who prefer a visual board format to track work across different stages. It’s easy to drag and drop issues between columns, providing a quick way to assess the status of tasks and manage workflow efficiently.

## Calendar layout
In the Calendar layout, issues are grouped by their due dates in a familiar calendar interface. This view helps you keep track of upcoming deadlines and spot issues that are due soon. Whether you’re planning sprints, tracking tasks for a specific time period, or just need a high-level view of your schedule, the Calendar layout keeps you organized and on top of important dates.

## Table layout
The Table layout presents issues in a tabular format, with rows for each issue and columns for all available properties. This view is especially useful for bulk actions or when you need to make similar changes to multiple issues at once. It’s a great option for teams who prefer working with large datasets and need a more granular level of control over issue details.

## Timeline layout
The Timeline layout shows issues in a Gantt chart format, which is ideal for teams who want to visualize the timeline of their project. Issues are arranged by their start and due dates, giving you a clear view of dependencies, deadlines, and progress. This view is great for tracking long-term projects, planning sprints, or coordinating work across multiple team members.
