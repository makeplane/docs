# Filter work items

Filtering work items in Plane helps you quickly locate, analyze, and manage tasks based on specific criteria.

## Options
- **Priority**  
Filter work items by their priority level (e.g., Urgent, High, Medium, Low) to focus on the most critical tasks.
- **State**  
View work items based on their current state, such as Todo, In Progress, or Done.
- **Work item Type**  
Filter by custom work item types, such as Bug, Feature, or Task.
- **Assignee**  
Focus on work items assigned to specific team members to track workloads or identify pending tasks.
- **Cycle**   
View work items tied to specific cycles to monitor progress within a timeframe.
- **Module**  
Filter work items by their associated module to analyze related tasks together.
- **Mention**  
Filter tasks where you or another team member has been mentioned to ensure no critical tasks are missed.
- **Created by**  
Identify work items created by specific individuals.
- **Label**  
Filter work items based on custom tags, such as "Frontend", or "Marketing".
- **Work item grouping**  
View all, active or backlog work items.
- **Start date and Target date**  
Filter work items by start dates to view tasks that are planned or already in progress, and by target dates to track upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks. For even more flexibility, you can specify a custom date range to focus on a specific timeframe.

## Multiple filters
You can apply multiple filters to refine your results further. Only work items that match all the selected criteria will be displayed. For instance, filtering for "High Priority" and "Assigned to Alice" will only show high-priority work items assigned to Alice.

## Save filters
Once you’ve applied filters, you can save your configuration as a custom view for easy access in the future. Custom views allow you to quickly switch between different perspectives, such as a high-priority tasks dashboard or a specific team’s workload. See [Views](/core-concepts/views) for more info.
