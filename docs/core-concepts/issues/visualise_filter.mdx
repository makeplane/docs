# Filter issues

Filtering issues in Plane helps you quickly locate, analyze, and manage tasks based on specific criteria. 

![Filter issues](https://media.docs.plane.so/issues/filter-issues.webp#center)

## Options
- **Priority**  
Filter issues by their priority level (e.g., Urgent, High, Medium, Low) to focus on the most critical tasks.
- **State**  
View issues based on their current state, such as Todo, In Progress, or Done.
- **Issue Type**  
Filter by custom issue types, such as Bug, Feature, or Task.
- **Assignee**  
Focus on issues assigned to specific team members to track workloads or identify pending tasks.
- **Cycle**   
View issues tied to specific cycles to monitor progress within a timeframe.
- **Module**  
Filter issues by their associated module to analyze related tasks together.
- **Mention**  
Filter tasks where you or another team member has been mentioned to ensure no critical tasks are missed.
- **Created by**  
Identify issues created by specific individuals.
- **Label**  
Filter issues based on custom tags, such as "Frontend", or "Marketing".
- **Issue grouping**  
View all, active or backlog issues.
- **Start date and Target date**  
Filter issues by start dates to view tasks that are planned or already in progress, and by target dates to track upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks. For even more flexibility, you can specify a custom date range to focus on a specific timeframe.

## Multiple filters
You can apply multiple filters to refine your results further. Only issues that match all the selected criteria will be displayed. For instance, filtering for "High Priority" and "Assigned to Alice" will only show high-priority issues assigned to Alice.

## Save filters
Once you’ve applied filters, you can save your configuration as a custom view for easy access in the future. Custom views allow you to quickly switch between different perspectives, such as a high-priority tasks dashboard or a specific team’s workload. See [Views](/core-concepts/views) for more info.
