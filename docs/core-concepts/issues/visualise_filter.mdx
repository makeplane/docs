# Filter work items

Filters help you find exactly the work items you need by applying conditions across multiple fields. Whether you're looking for overdue tasks assigned to your team or tracking items in specific states, filters give you the control to slice through your work items with precision.

With rich filters, you can now choose from different operators for each field type, giving you even more control over how you filter your work items.

## How to use filters

Filters live in their own dedicated row below the main toolbar, making them always accessible while you work with your work items.

### Basic filtering

To start filtering your work items:

1. Click the Filters icon button to open a dropdown with all the fields. 
2. Select any field (State, Priority, Assignee, etc.) to add a filter condition.
3. Choose your operator from the dropdown (like "is", "is not", "after", etc.).
4. Select one or more values you want to filter the field by. 
5. Your work items update instantly to match your criteria.

### Build complex filters

You can combine multiple filters to create powerful queries:

**Find urgent items for your team:**
- Set **Priority** → **is** → `High`
- Add **Assignee** → **in** → [Select team members]
- Add **State** → **is not** → `Done`

**Track overdue work:**
- Set **Target date** → **before** → [Select date]
- Add **State group** → **is not** → `Completed`

**Review items without assignments:**
- Set **Assignee** → is → [Leave empty]
- Add State → in → [Backlog, To Do]

### Work with date filters

Date filters are particularly powerful for project management:

**This week's deliverables:**
- Set **Target date** → **between** → [[Select date range]

**Items starting soon:**
- Set **Start Date** → **after or on** → [Select date]
- Add **Start Date** → **before or on** → [Select date]

**Overdue items:**
- Set **Target date** → **before** → [Select date]
- Add **State group** → **is not** → [Completed]

## Manage your filters

- **Clear specific filters:**  
Click the **X** next to any filter condition to remove just that filter.

- **Clear all filters:**  
Use the **Clear all** button to start fresh.

- **Save your view:**  
Once you've built the perfect filter combination, use **Save view** to preserve your configuration as a custom view for easy access in the future. Views allow you to quickly switch between different perspectives, such as a high-priority tasks dashboard or a specific team’s workload. See [Views](/core-concepts/views) for more details.

## Filter operators reference
