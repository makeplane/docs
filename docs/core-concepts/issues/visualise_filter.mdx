title: Visualise and filter issues
---

In Plane, you have several options for visualizing and filtering issues to help you quickly analyze and investigate them.

### Layouts

-  **List View:** Displays issues as an ordered list. Supports grouping by specific issue properties for easy categorization.

-  **Kanban View:** Groups issues by a specific property in a Kanban board format, typically by issue states. Allows for quick assessment of issues' status.

- **Calendar View:** Groups issues by due dates in a calendar interface, facilitating quick identification of issues due soon.

- **Spreadsheet View:** Arranges issues as rows in a spreadsheet, with all properties available as columns. Useful for taking similar actions on multiple issues.

- **Gantt View:** Arranges issues by start and due dates in a Gantt chart format, providing a visual representation of issue timelines.

### Filter Issues

Issues can be filtered by various properties, including:

 1. Priority
 2. State
 3. Start date
 4. Due date
 5. Assignee
 6. Labels
 7. Modules
 8. Cycles
 9. Created by
10. Mentions

When applying multiple filters, only issues matching all filter criteria are displayed. Note that when filtering issues in a workspace view, filtering by state, cycles, or modules is not yet supported.
