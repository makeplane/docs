When similar issues clutter a workspace, they confuse team members and make it harder to track and manage project scope.  

Our De-dup feature helps you catch and manage duplicate issues in Plane.

## How De-dup works

Plane flags duplicate issues both when creating a new one and when viewing an issue's details. 

### Detect duplicates during issue creation

When you create a new issue, Plane scans titles and descriptions for similar content and notifies you if it finds potential duplicates.

You can click on the issues to check and decide if creating a new one is necessary or if updating an existing one makes more sense.

### Mark or delete duplicate issues

You can mark issues as duplicates or delete them in the issue detail view.

When you open an issue, Plane analyses and lists similar issues. You can select one or more of these issues and mark them duplicates. This will add a "Duplicate of" relation to connect them.
