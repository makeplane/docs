Work item Types unlock a whole new way of adding, editing, and moving work forward in Plane. The default work item type called `Issue` is great for starting with Plane, but as you advance in your project management journey, you find the need for names and properties unique to the type of work you are doing.

For example, your Marketing team may need a work item type called `Content` with the properties, `Channel`, `SEO done?`, and `Reviewer` — properties that aren't available on the default Work items. Your Engineering team, on the other hand, may want a work item type called `Bugs` with the properties `Version` and `Environment` to have more upfront info per bug reported.

Work item Types make these and infinite other use cases possible.

## Use work item types

Once the project Admin sets up the work item types any project member can use them when creating work items or sub-work items.

- In the **Create new work item** modal, the user can choose the desired work item type from the list at the top left corner. By default, the work item type `Issue` is selected displaying both system-defined and custom properties.
- Changing the work item type will update the modal to display the relevant properties for that type.
- The system ensures that all properties marked as mandatory are filled before creating the work item.
  ![Use work item types](https://media.docs.plane.so/issues/use-issue-type.webp#center)

When viewing work items, the work item type is displayed with an icon near the title for easy identification. Any custom properties added will also appear in the list of properties, and changes to these values are tracked in the work item's activity trail.

## Switch work item types

You can easily switch the work item's type at any time. Just follow these steps:

1. Open the work item you’d like to update.
2. Hover over to the right of the work item ID and click **Switch work item type**. Alternatively, you can click **Edit** from the work item's ellipsis (•••) menu to open the **Update work item** modal directly.
   ![Switch work item type](https://media.docs.plane.so/issues/switch-issue-type.webp#center)
3. Choose the new work item type from the dropdown next to your project name.
   ![Update work item type](https://media.docs.plane.so/issues/update-issue-type.webp#center)
4. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## Bulk update work item types

You can change the work item types for several work items at once. Here’s how:

1. Switch to the **Spreadsheet** layout in the Work items page.
2. Select the work items you want to update.
3. At the bottom of your screen, open the **Work item type** dropdown and pick the new work item type.
   ![Bulk update work item types](https://media.docs.plane.so/issues/bulk-update-issue-types.webp#center)
4. Click **Update** to apply the changes.

## Disable work item types

You can temporarily pause the creation of new work items for a specific work item type without affecting existing ones.

1. Head to the **Work item types** screen in your project's settings.
2. Toggle off the switch next to the work item type you want to disable.
