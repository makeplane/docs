## Overview

Log time per work item, record time by members and guests per work item, and download consolidated worklogs from one screen with Time Tracking in Plane.

Project members can easily log the time they spend working on specific work items directly within the work item details page. Each time entry can include details such as the amount of time spent and optional notes to provide context. Plane also offers comprehensive reports that aggregate time-tracking data across different projects helping managers analyze productivity and ensure successful project delivery.
