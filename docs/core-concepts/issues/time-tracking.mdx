## Overview

Log time per issue, record time by members and guests per issue, and download consolidated worklogs from one screen with Time Tracking in Plane.

Project members can easily log the time they spend working on specific issues directly within the issue details page. Each time entry can include details such as the amount of time spent and optional notes to provide context. Plane also offers comprehensive reports that aggregate time-tracking data across different projects helping managers analyze productivity and ensure successful project delivery.
