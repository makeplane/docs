Working with multiple issues at once can save you significant time.

## Bulk edit issues

To perform bulk operations:

1. Make sure you're in either the **List** or **Table** layout - bulk operations aren't available in other layouts. 
2. Select issues by clicking the checkbox next to each one, or use the select all checkbox at the top of the list. 
3. After selecting issues, update the available properties at the bottom of the screen.
4. Click the **Update** button to apply your modifications. Until you click this button, your changes won't be saved.


## Available bulk operations

You can modify several properties across multiple issues simultaneously:

- Change the state (like moving issues from "In Progress" to "Done")
- Update priority levels
- Assign or reassign team members
- Add issues to cycles
- Change issue types
- Apply or remove labels
- Set or modify modules
- Add or update start and due dates

## Subscribe to multiple issues
If you need to keep track of several issues at once, you can subscribe to multiple issues in a single operation. This ensures you'll receive notifications about any updates to those issues.

## Manage issue lifecycle
You can also perform bulk management actions:

- Archive multiple issues when they're no longer active but you want to preserve their history.
- Delete multiple issues if they're no longer needed (note: this action cannot be undone)

## Tips for bulk operations

- Take advantage of filters to select related issues more easily.
- Double-check your selection before performing destructive actions like deletion.
- Consider using bulk operations during project transitions or when doing major reorganization of work
