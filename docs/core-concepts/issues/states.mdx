# Manage work item progress using States

Managing work items effectively is at the heart of every project, and Plane provides a robust system for organizing them into states that represent the stages of a work item's lifecycle. As work items transition through these states—from backlog to completion—they reflect the progression of work in your project, forming a clear and efficient workflow for your team.

## State groups

Plane organizes work item states into five primary groups, each serving a distinct purpose in your project’s workflow:

- **Backlog**  
Use this group for work items that aren’t ready to be prioritized yet. They might need more discussions or preparation before moving forward. By default, Plane creates a state called **Backlog** in this group.

- **Unstarted**  
This group represents work items that are planned but not yet in progress. They’re essentially your team’s to-do list. The default state in this group is **Todo**.

- **Started**  
Work items in this group are actively being worked on. They represent ongoing tasks and are crucial for tracking current progress. Plane creates a default state called **In Progress** here.

- **Completed**  
These states are for work items that your team has successfully finished. By default, Plane includes a **Done** state in this group.

- **Cancelled**: Use this group for work items that are no longer relevant or actionable. Plane provides a default state called **Cancelled** for this purpose.

## Customize states
You can customize each state group to match your project's workflow by adding, editing, or removing states. 

Navigate to the **States** tab under **Project > Settings**.

### Add state
1. Click the "+" button next to the group where you want the new state.
2. Rearrange states within the group to reflect your preferred workflow.

You can also designate a state as the default for the project. New work items without an assigned state will automatically fall into this default state.

### Edit state 
1. Hover over the state you want to edit.
2. Click the pencil icon and change the name and description. 
2. Click **Update** to save changes.

### Delete state

Before removing a state, ensure no work items are currently assigned to it. Once it's clear, you can delete the state by clicking the **x** icon on the state.
