Organize your content hierarchically using six heading levels:

- **H1**: Main page title (use only once per page)
- **H2**: Primary sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **H4-H6**: Further content subdivision when needed

## To do

Adds checkable items for tracking tasks and their completion status.

## Bullet list

Creates unordered lists for items where sequence doesn't matter.

## Numbered list

Creates ordered lists when sequence or priority matters.

## Table

Organizes information in rows and columns for structured data presentation.

## Quote

Highlights quoted text or important statements with distinct formatting.

## Code

Displays code snippets or command-line text with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.

  ## Embed
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

Seamlessly integrate external content directly into your documents with rich, interactive embeds. The embed feature supports a wide variety of platforms and content types, making it easy to enhance your documentation with multimedia and interactive elements.

![Embed](https://media.docs.plane.so/pages/external-embeds.webp#hero)

  Use the `/embed` slash command to quickly insert an embed block. 

This opens an embed dialog where you can paste any supported link. The system automatically detects the content type and creates an appropriate embed with a rich preview. This eliminates the need for users to navigate away from your content to view referenced materials.

## Image
Inserts and displays images within your content. 

<div className="tag-wrapper">
 ## Attachment
<Tags 
  tags={[ 
    { name: "Pro", link:"https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }
  ]} 
 />
</div>

Uploads and embeds files directly into your content, supporting documents, images, and other file types up to 100MB each.

#### Show video preview
When you upload video files as attachments, you can display them with inline playback controls. Just hover over the block and click the **⋮⋮** icon that appears. Select **Show preview** to convert the file link into an embedded video player. This works for all supported video formats.

 ## Video
<Tags 
  tags={[ 
    { name: "Business", link:"https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "business" }
  ]} 
 />
</div>

Embeds video content directly into your pages for rich multimedia documentation.

![Embed videos](https://media.docs.plane.so/pages/embed-videos.webp#hero)

Type `/video` to insert a video block, then upload a video file. The video appears inline with playback controls, allowing viewers to watch without leaving the page. Supported video formats include MP4, MPEG, OGG Video, WebM, QuickTime, AVI, and WMV. 

#### Show as attachment
If you have a video displayed with inline preview and want to convert it to a simple file link, hover over the video block and select **Show as attachment** from the actions menu. This collapses the video player into a compact attachment link.

## Math equations

</div>

Add mathematical expressions and formulas to your Pages using LaTeX syntax. Whether you need to document complex calculations, display statistical formulas, or include scientific notations, Plane supports both inline and block-style mathematical equations. This is perfect for technical documentation, engineering specs, data analysis reports, and any content requiring precise mathematical notation.

![Math equations](https://media.docs.plane.so/pages/math-equations.webp#hero)

### Block equation
Creates standalone mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. Block equations are displayed on their own line with centered formatting, perfect for formulas, theorems, and complex mathematical statements that need emphasis.

Use the `/blockequation` slash command:
  ```
  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
  ```
Or use double dollar syntax:
  ```latex
  $$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) $$
  ```

### Inline equation
Embeds mathematical expressions within regular text flow using LaTeX syntax. Inline equations maintain the same text baseline, allowing you to seamlessly integrate mathematical notation into sentences and paragraphs.

Use the `/inlineequation` slash command:
  ```
  \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
  ```
Or use single dollar syntax: 
  ```latex
  $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
  ```

Both equation types support full LaTeX rendering with built-in validation and error handling for invalid mathematical expressions.

</div>

:::tip[Prerequisites]
Before you can add Draw.io diagrams to Pages or Wiki, you need to [connect the Draw.io integration](/integrations/draw-io) from Workspace Settings.
:::

Create and manage interactive diagrams and whiteboards directly within your Pages using the integrated Draw.io editor. Whether you need professional flowcharts, system architecture diagrams, or freehand sketches for brainstorming, the diagram feature provides powerful visual documentation capabilities without leaving Plane.

![Draw.io diagram](https://media.docs.plane.so/pages/draw-io-diagram.webp#hero)

### Diagram
Create professional diagrams, flowcharts, and visual documentation using the full Draw.io editor with comprehensive shape libraries. Perfect for technical documentation, process flows, system architecture, network diagrams, and organizational charts.
Use the `/diagram` or `/drawio-diagram` slash command to insert a diagram block. Click the placeholder to launch the Draw.io editor.

### Board
Create whiteboards with freehand drawing and sketching capabilities using a simplified interface. Ideal for brainstorming sessions, quick mockups, concept visualization, and collaborative ideation.
Use the `/board` or `/drawio-board` slash command to insert a whiteboard block. Click the placeholder that says "Click to start editing whiteboard" to launch the board interface.

Both modes feature a consistent toolbar with **Save** and **Exit** buttons, making it easy to preserve your work and return to your Page. All diagrams are fully interactive—simply click any saved diagram to edit it again.

## Callout   
Creates visually distinct sections with customizable icons and colors for highlighting warnings, tips , and calls-to-action.

<div className="tag-wrapper">
  ## Work item embed
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

References work items directly in the editor to track details and progress.

## Divider

Adds a horizontal line to separate content sections visually.

## Emoji
