List of all the content blocks available in the page, description and comment editors.

## Text

The standard block for paragraph text and general content.

## Headings (H1 - H6)

Organize your content hierarchically using six heading levels:

- **H1**: Main page title (use only once per page)
- **H2**: Primary sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **H4-H6**: Further content subdivision when needed

## To do

Adds checkable items for tracking tasks and their completion status.

## Bullet list

Creates unordered lists for items where sequence doesn't matter.

## Numbered list

Creates ordered lists when sequence or priority matters.

## Table

Organizes information in rows and columns for structured data presentation.

## Quote

Highlights quoted text or important statements with distinct formatting.

## Code

Displays code snippets or command-line text with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.

## Image
Inserts and displays images within your content.

 ## Attachment
<Tags 
  tags={[ 
    { name: "Pro", link:"https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }
  ]} 
 />
</div>

### Block equation
Creates standalone mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. Block equations are displayed on their own line with centered formatting, perfect for formulas, theorems, and complex mathematical statements that need emphasis.

Use the `/blockequation` slash command or double dollar syntax:
  ```latex
  $$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) $$
  ```

### Inline equation
Embeds mathematical expressions within regular text flow using LaTeX syntax. Inline equations maintain the same text baseline, allowing you to seamlessly integrate mathematical notation into sentences and paragraphs.

Use the `/inlineequation` slash command or single dollar syntax: 
  ```latex
  $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
  ```

Both equation types support full LaTeX rendering with built-in validation and error handling for invalid mathematical expressions.

## Callout   
Creates visually distinct sections with customizable icons and colors for highlighting warnings, tips , and calls-to-action.

<div className="tag-wrapper">
  ## Work item embed
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

References work items directly in the editor to track details and progress.

## Divider

Adds a horizontal line to separate content sections visually.

## Emoji

Add emojis to your content across all Plane editors. Type `/emoji` to open the picker or use `:` and start typing for suggestions like `:smile:`. Choose from standard Unicode emojis and GitHub's extended collection.
