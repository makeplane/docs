List of all the content blocks available in the page, description and comment editors.

## Text

The standard block for paragraph text and general content.

## Headings (H1 - H6)

Organize your content hierarchically using six heading levels:

- **H1**: Main page title (use only once per page)
- **H2**: Primary sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **H4-H6**: Further content subdivision when needed

## To do

Adds checkable items for tracking tasks and their completion status.

## Bullet list

Creates unordered lists for items where sequence doesn't matter.

## Numbered list

Creates ordered lists when sequence or priority matters.

## Table

Organizes information in rows and columns for structured data presentation.

## Quote

Highlights quoted text or important statements with distinct formatting.

## Code

Displays code snippets or command-line text with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.

  ## Embed
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

Seamlessly integrate external content directly into your documents with rich, interactive embeds. The embed feature supports a wide variety of platforms and content types, making it easy to enhance your documentation with multimedia and interactive elements.

  Use the `/embed` slash command to quickly insert an embed block. 

This opens an embed dialog where you can paste any supported link. The system automatically detects the content type and creates an appropriate embed with a rich preview. This eliminates the need for users to navigate away from your content to view referenced materials.

## Image
Inserts and displays images within your content. 

<div className="tag-wrapper">
 ## Attachment
<Tags 
  tags={[ 
    { name: "Pro", link:"https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }
  ]} 
 />
</div>

Uploads and embeds files directly into your content, supporting documents, images, and other file types up to 100MB each.

</div>

Add mathematical expressions and formulas to your Pages using LaTeX syntax. Whether you need to document complex calculations, display statistical formulas, or include scientific notations, Plane supports both inline and block-style mathematical equations. This is perfect for technical documentation, engineering specs, data analysis reports, and any content requiring precise mathematical notation.

### Block equation
Creates standalone mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. Block equations are displayed on their own line with centered formatting, perfect for formulas, theorems, and complex mathematical statements that need emphasis.

Use the `/blockequation` slash command:
  ```
  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
  ```
Or use double dollar syntax:
  ```latex
  $$ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) $$
  ```

### Inline equation
Embeds mathematical expressions within regular text flow using LaTeX syntax. Inline equations maintain the same text baseline, allowing you to seamlessly integrate mathematical notation into sentences and paragraphs.

Use the `/inlineequation` slash command:
  ```
  \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
  ```
Or use single dollar syntax: 
  ```latex
  $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
  ```

Both equation types support full LaTeX rendering with built-in validation and error handling for invalid mathematical expressions.

## Callout   
Creates visually distinct sections with customizable icons and colors for highlighting warnings, tips , and calls-to-action.

<div className="tag-wrapper">
  ## Work item embed
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

References work items directly in the editor to track details and progress.

## Divider

Adds a horizontal line to separate content sections visually.

## Emoji

Add emojis to your content across all Plane editors. Type `/emoji` to open the picker or use `:` and start typing for suggestions like `:smile:`. Choose from standard Unicode emojis and GitHub's extended collection.
