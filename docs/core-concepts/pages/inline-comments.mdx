Inline comments allow you to collaborate directly within your documentation by highlighting specific text and starting focused discussions. This feature is available across Project pages, Wiki pages, and Teamspace pages.

## Overview

When you need to discuss, clarify, or provide feedback on specific content in your pages, inline comments let you anchor conversations directly to the relevant text. Team members can respond to comments, mention colleagues, and mark discussions as resolved once they're addressed.

## Where you can use inline comments

Inline comments work across three different page types in Plane:

- **Project pages**  
Collaborate on project-specific documentation with your project team. Comments are visible to all project members.

- **Wiki pages**  
Discuss workspace-wide documentation that spans multiple projects. All workspace members can view and participate in these conversations.

- **Teamspace pages**  
Have focused discussions within your teamspace. Only teamspace members have access to these comments.

Each location functions independently, allowing you to keep conversations contextual to their scope.

## Add an inline comment

![Add inline comment](https://media.docs.plane.so/pages/add-inline-comment.webp#center)

To comment on specific text within any page:

1. Select the text you want to comment on by clicking and dragging across it.
2. A comment icon will appear in the formatting toolbar above your selection.
3. Click the icon to open the comment panel on the right.
4. Type your comment in the text box.
5. Optionally, attach images to provide visual context. See [Attach images](#attach-images-to-comments) below.
6. Press the send button or use the keyboard shortcut to post.

Your comment will be anchored to the selected text, indicated by highlighting on the page.

## Attach images to comments
You can add images to any comment or reply to provide screenshots, diagrams, or visual references:

- In the comment input field, click the attachment icon.
- Select an image file from your device.
- The image will be uploaded and attached to your comment.
- You can attach multiple images to a single comment if needed. 

## Mention team members

To bring specific people into the conversation:

1. Type `@` in the comment box.
2. A dropdown menu will appear showing available team members.
3. Start typing a name to filter the list.
4. Click on the person you want to mention, or use arrow keys and press Enter.

<!-- Mentioned team members will receive a notification about the comment. -->

## Reply to comments

To continue a conversation thread:

1. Navigate to the Comments panel on the right side of the page.
2. Find the comment you want to respond to.
3. Click **Reply** below the comment.
4. Type your response in the reply field.
5. Send your reply.

Replies are threaded under the original comment, keeping related discussions organized.

## Manage comment status

### Resolve comments

When a discussion is complete or an issue has been addressed:

1. Locate the checkmark icon next to the comment (in the top-right area).
2. Click the checkmark icon.
3. Select **Mark as resolved**.

The comment will be hidden from the default view and moved to the resolved comments list.

### Unresolve comments

If a discussion needs to be reopened or the issue resurfaces:

1. Use the Filters button to show resolved comments.
2. Locate the resolved comment you want to reopen.
3. Click the checkmark icon next to the comment.
4. Select **Mark as unresolved**.

The comment will return to the active comments list and become visible in the default view.

### Filter comments

Use the **Filters** button in the Comments panel to control which comments you see:

- **Show active**  
Displays only unresolved comments (default view).
- **Show resolved**  
Displays only resolved comments.
- **Show all**  
Displays all comments regardless of status.

This helps you focus on conversations that still need attention or review closed discussions when needed.

## Edit and delete comments

To modify or remove your own comments:

1. Click the three-dot menu (•••) next to your comment.
2. Choose either:
   - **Edit**  
   Modify the comment text and save your changes.
   - **Delete**   
   Permanently remove the comment.

Note that only the comment author can edit or delete their own comments.

## Permissions and visibility

Comment permissions align with page access:

- **Project pages**  
Project admins and members can view and comment on all project pages. If you have access to view the project page, you can participate in its comment threads.

- **Wiki pages**  
Workspace admins and members can view and comment on wiki pages. For private pages that have been shared with you, you can also add and view comments based on your sharing permissions.

- **Teamspace pages**  
Only teamspace members can view and comment on teamspace pages. These comments remain private to the teamspace and are not visible to users outside the teamspace.
