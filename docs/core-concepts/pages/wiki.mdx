# Centralized documentation with Wiki

Planeâ€™s Wiki feature allows you to create and manage company-wide wikis or knowledge bases independently of any specific project. Whether you want to document company policies, onboarding materials, technical guides, or any other organizational knowledge, Wiki ensures all your information is centralized and accessible.

## Why use the Wiki
While Plane's Pages feature is project-specific, the Wiki is designed to house broader content that spans across the entire organization. This makes it ideal for storing documentation that isn't tied to a single project. With Wiki, your team can access the resources they need without digging through individual projects.

## How to access Wiki
