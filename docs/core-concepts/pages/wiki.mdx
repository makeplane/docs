Plane's Wiki is a place to store and share company-wide information. Unlike project pages that focus on specific work, the Wiki helps you create documentation that matters to everyone in the organization.

## What makes Wiki useful

The Wiki works best for content that goes beyond a single project:

- Company policies
- Onboarding materials
- Technical guides
- Organizational knowledge

Where project pages zoom in on team-specific details, the Wiki gives you a bird's-eye view of your company's information.

## How to access Wiki
