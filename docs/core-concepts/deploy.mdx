# Create public project boards

Any project you build in Plane can be turned into a public page, creating a fully navigable website. This makes it easy for your users and customers to see your latest features or when bug fixes roll out—no sign-up required.

## How to publish project

Only Admins can publish a project in Plane. Here’s how:

1. Open your Plane workspace and navigate to the project you want to publish.
2. Click on the ellipsis **...** icon next to the project name to access the project settings menu.
3. Select **Publish** from the dropdown menu, which will open a modal dialog.
4. Configure your public board options in this modal.
5. Once ready, click **Publish**. You'll be instantly redirected to your new public board.

## Publish features

### Layout options

You can publish your project in either **Kanban** or **List** layouts. Choose whichever view best fits your project, or turn on both to give viewers more flexibility. Soon, Gantt and Spreadsheet layouts will also be available.

You can host your public board on a free domain, making it simple and accessible for anyone to check out your project. No additional setup or domain registration is required; simply choose this option during the publishing process, and your public board will be instantly accessible via the free domain.
