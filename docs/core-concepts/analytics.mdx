# Analytics

Transform your entire workspace data into actionable insights with Analytics. Get instant answers to complex questions, forecast demand, track progress across all dimensions, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

![Analytics Overview](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/analytics-overview.webp#center)

The enhanced visualization experience brings your data to life with interactive charts featuring hover details and tooltips that provide instant context as you explore your metrics. 

## Analytics access levels

Plane Analytics operates at multiple levels to provide the right insights:

*   **Workspace level**  
Users in the `Admin` roles have access to Analytics at the Workspace level. You can locate it on the left sidebar.

*   **Project level**  
Users with `Admin`, or `Member` roles can access project-specific analytics. Navigate to your project and find Analytics in the top navigation bar.

*   **Cycle and Module level**  
Drill down into specific cycles or modules for focused insights. Access through the respective Cycle or Module views with Analytics in the top bar.

## Analytics types
The new analytics experience provides comprehensive views across six key areas:

### Overview
Get a bird's-eye view of your entire workspace with essential performance indicators that drive strategic decision-making. The workspace metrics section displays comprehensive user statistics including total users, admins, members, and guests, alongside project count and distribution across your organization. You can monitor the overall work item count across all projects and track active cycles and intake statistics to understand your team's current workload.

### Projects analysis

The project status tracking features provide a complete breakdown of your total project count with comprehensive status analysis, enabling you to quickly identify on-track, off-track, and at-risk projects. Visual charts display project distribution by current state, whether in draft, execution, or other phases, helping you understand your project pipeline at a glance.

### Work items analysis
![Analytics Work Items](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/work-item-analytics.webp#center)

The work item metrics section displays total work items with state-based breakdown, showing started, backlog, unstarted, and completed counts to give you a complete picture of your team's workload distribution. The created vs resolved trend analysis tracks progress over time, while velocity and completion rate tracking helps you understand team performance patterns.

#### Customized insights
![Customized insights](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/customized-insights.webp#center)

The interactive chart builder offers flexible measure options including work item count and estimate points, allowing you to focus on the metrics that matter most to your team. Dimension analysis capabilities cover state name, state group, priority, label, assignee, estimate point, and cycle, providing multiple perspectives on your data.

The priority section delivers a comprehensive breakdown by priority levels including high, medium, low, urgent, and none categories.

You can easily export all your analytics data to CSV format, making it simple to dive deeper into the numbers using spreadsheets or other analysis tools you prefer.

### Cycles analysis
![Analytics Cycles](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/cycle-analytics.webp#center)

The cycle metrics section provides total cycle count with comprehensive status breakdown, tracking current, upcoming, and completed cycles to help you manage your sprint planning effectively. Cycle progress visualization displays completion percentages and performance indicators to keep teams aligned on sprint goals.

Progress tracking includes sophisticated scatter plot analysis showing cycle completion rates across different time periods, individual cycle performance data with lead and project information for accountability, and comprehensive start and end date tracking with completion percentages.

### Modules analysis
![Analytics Modules](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/module-analytics.webp#center)

The module overview section displays total module count across all projects with detailed status distribution covering completed, in progress, planned, and paused modules. Module progress visualization includes scatter plots with completion percentages to help you understand development velocity and identify potential delays.

Individual module tracking provides detailed information including lead assignment and responsibility mapping, project-wise module distribution for cross-project visibility, and progress percentage analysis with timeline tracking.

### Intake analysis
![Analytics Intake](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/Intake-analytics.webp#center)

The intake metrics section tracks total intake items with status breakdown, monitoring accepted, declined, and duplicate requests to help you understand demand patterns. 

Trend analysis capabilities include historical intake pattern recognition that reveals seasonal variations and cyclical demand, acceptance rate monitoring to understand how well requests align with team capacity, and project-wise intake distribution analysis. 

## Export analytics

You can export comprehensive data from every analytics view with our CSV export functionality, giving you the flexibility to perform deeper analysis using your preferred external tools. The export process is designed for simplicity with one-click data downloads that include detailed datasets containing all relevant metrics and dimensions from your selected view.

Access to export functionality is carefully controlled and available only to users with an Admin role, ensuring your sensitive project data remains secure.
