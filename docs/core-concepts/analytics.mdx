# View analytics at different levels

Transform your entire workspace data into actionable insights with Analytics. Get instant answers to complex questions, forecast demand, track progress across all dimensions, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

![Analytics Overview](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/analytics-overview.webp#center)

The enhanced visualization experience brings your data to life with interactive charts featuring hover details and tooltips that provide instant context as you explore your metrics.

## Analytics access levels

Plane Analytics operates at multiple levels to provide the right insights:

- **Workspace level**  
  Users in the `Admin` roles have access to Analytics at the Workspace level. You can locate it on the left sidebar.

- **Project level**  
  Users with `Admin`, or `Member` roles can access project-specific analytics. Navigate to your project and find Analytics in the top navigation bar.

- **Cycle and Module level**  
  Drill down into specific cycles or modules for focused insights. Access through the respective Cycle or Module views with Analytics in the top bar.

## Analytics types

The new analytics experience provides comprehensive views across six key areas:

### Overview

Get a bird's-eye view of your entire workspace with essential performance indicators that drive strategic decision-making. The workspace metrics section displays comprehensive user statistics including total users, admins, members, and guests, alongside project count and distribution across your organization. You can monitor the overall work item count across all projects and track active cycles and intake statistics to understand your team's current workload.

</div>
![Analytics Projects](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/projects-analytics.webp#center)

The Projects analytics tab gives you a clear snapshot of how all your projects are performing across your workspace. Right at the top, you'll see the big picture numbers - your total project count along with a health check showing how many are on-track, off-track, or at risk. This instant overview helps you quickly spot if anything needs your attention.

The _Projects by status_ chart breaks things down by where each project sits in its lifecycle. You can see how many projects are still in draft phase versus those that are actively in execution. It's a handy way to understand your project pipeline and see if you've got a good balance between planning and doing.

Below that, you'll find a detailed table that shows you the nitty-gritty details - how many team members are involved, the number of epics and work items, which cycles and modules are part of the project, and even how many pages and views have been created. There's also an intake column that tracks incoming requests or ideas for each project.

What's really useful here is that you can search through all your projects if you're looking for something specific, and of course, export everything to CSV if you want to do some deeper analysis or create reports for stakeholders.

### Work items analysis

![Analytics Work Items](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/work-item-analytics.webp#center)

The Work Items tab is where you can really dig into what your team is actually working on day-to-day. The top section gives you the essential numbers at a glance -total work items with state-based breakdown, showing started, backlog, unstarted, and completed counts to give you a complete picture of your team's workload distribution. It's a great way to get a sense of your team's current workload and how much is getting done versus how much is piling up.

The _Created vs Resolved_ chart tells about your team's workflow patterns. The green area shows your resolution rate - how many items are actually getting closed out over time. The gap between created and resolved items gives you a visual sense of whether you're keeping up with demand or if things are starting to pile up.

#### Customized insights

![Customized insights](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/customized-insights.webp#center)

The interactive chart builder lets you choose what you want to measure and then break it down by any dimension that matters to you - whether that's priority, assignee, state, labels, or cycles. You can quickly spot things like priority distribution imbalances, workload concentration among team members, or bottlenecks in specific workflow states. The visual breakdown makes it easy to see proportions and identify outliers at a glance.

You can easily export all your analytics data to CSV format, making it simple to dive deeper into the numbers using spreadsheets or other analysis tools you prefer.

  ### Cycles analysis

</div>

![Analytics Cycles](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/cycle-analytics.webp#center)

The Cycles tab gives you a comprehensive look at how your sprints and cycles are performing across your workspace. The summary metrics at the top provide an instant snapshot of your cycle pipeline - you can see your total cycle count broken down into current, upcoming, and completed cycles, which helps you understand your team's sprint cadence and planning horizon.

The _Cycle progress_ scatter plot shows each cycle's completion percentage, giving you an immediate visual sense of how different sprints are progressing. You can quickly spot cycles that might be falling behind or identify patterns in how your team typically performs throughout a sprint. The color coding makes it easy to distinguish between current work, future planning, and completed cycles at a glance.

What makes this view particularly valuable is the detailed hover information that appears when you examine individual cycles. You get a complete breakdown of the work within each cycle - how many items are completed, started, unstarted, in backlog, or cancelled. This level of detail helps you understand not just whether a cycle is on track, but why it might be ahead or behind schedule.

The cycle table at the bottom provides all the essential management information in one place - who's leading each cycle, which project it belongs to, the planned timeline, and current completion percentage. This makes it easy to spot potential issues like cycles that are running over their planned end dates or identify which team leads might need support.

This kind of cycle analysis is invaluable for sprint retrospectives and improving your team's estimation accuracy over time. You can identify patterns in cycle performance and use that data to make better decisions about sprint planning and workload distribution.

  ### Modules analysis
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

![Analytics Modules](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/module-analytics.webp#center)

The Modules tab gives you visibility into how your bigger pieces of work are progressing. The summary at the top shows your module pipeline - you can see how many modules are completed, actively in progress, still in planning, or paused.

The module progress scatter plot is really useful for getting a visual sense of where everything stands. Each dot represents a module, and you can quickly scan across to see which ones are making good progress, which might be stalled, or which are just getting started. The color coding helps you distinguish between different module states at a glance - whether something's in backlog, planned, in progress, completed, or cancelled.

When you hover over any module in the chart, you get a detailed breakdown of the work within it - how many work items are completed, started, unstarted, or cancelled. It's especially helpful for spotting modules that might look like they're progressing but actually have a lot of work still sitting unstarted.

The table gives you all the management essentials - who's leading each module, which project it belongs to, planned timelines, and current completion status. This makes it easy to identify modules that might need attention, whether that's because they're running behind schedule, don't have a clear lead assigned, or are sitting at 0% completion when they should have started by now.

  ### Intake analysis
  <Tags tags={[{ name: "Pro", link: "https://plane.so/pricing", additionalClass: "pro" }]} />
</div>

![Analytics Intake](https://media.docs.plane.so/analytics/Intake-analytics.webp#center)

The Intake tab gives you valuable insights into how work requests flow into your system and how your team manages that incoming demand. The summary metrics at the top provide a quick overview of your total intake volume along with the breakdown of what's been accepted, declined, or marked as duplicate. This helps you understand both the volume of requests coming in and how effectively your team is triaging and processing them.

The _Intake trends_ chart is particularly useful for understanding demand patterns over time. You can see when request volume spikes or dips, which helps with capacity planning and understanding seasonal patterns in your workload. The timeline view shows both accepted and declined requests, giving you insight into not just when demand is high, but also when your team's filtering process is most active.

This kind of trend analysis is really valuable for predicting future demand and understanding whether your intake process is keeping up with the flow of requests. If you see periods where lots of requests come in but very few get accepted or declined, it might indicate bottlenecks in your triage process.

The project breakdown table at the bottom shows how intake is distributed across different areas of your organization. This helps you identify which projects are generating the most requests, and how different areas handle their intake processing. You can spot patterns like certain projects having higher acceptance rates, or identify areas where requests might be sitting unprocessed.

## Export analytics

You can export comprehensive data from every analytics view with our CSV export functionality, giving you the flexibility to perform deeper analysis using your preferred external tools. The export process is designed for simplicity with one-click data downloads that include detailed datasets containing all relevant metrics and dimensions from your selected view.

Export functionality is available only to users with an Admin role.
