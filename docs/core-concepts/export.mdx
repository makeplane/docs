# Export data

Plane allows you to export all your work items—from a single project or multiple projects—so you can access your data outside of Plane. You can export work items into CSV, Excel, or JSON formats. Additionally, you can choose how you'd like the data to be packaged: in a single consolidated file or split into separate files (downloaded as a ZIP).

:::caution[Limitation]
All key fields related to your work items are included in the export, except for work item types, custom properties, relations, links, attachments, and estimates. We're actively working on adding these soon.

4.  **Select Project**  
    After selecting your format:
    - Choose to export work items from all projects or a specific project using the dropdown.
    - _Optional_: If exporting work items from all projects, you can split the data into separate files. This will package the exports into a ZIP file.

Export filtered work items, cycles, views, or modules directly from your project. Custom exports let you export exactly what you see after applying filters and display options—perfect for reports, analysis, or sharing specific data sets.

You can export data from:

- Work items: Export filtered issue lists from any view
- Cycles: Export work items within a specific cycle
- Modules: Export work items within a specific module
- Views: Export custom filtered views you've saved
