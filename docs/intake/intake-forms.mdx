Now, you can easily gather bug reports, feature requests, or support tickets from external users, all by sharing a
simple form link.

## Enable Intake Forms

Head to your Project settings and toggle on the **Forms** option under the **Features** tab. This will generate a unique URL for collecting Intake work items. If the URL ever gets compromised, you can regenerate it by clicking **Renew**, ensuring only the right people can submit work items.

## Share the link

Share the link with anyone who needs to submit a work item. They’ll land on a simple form where they can fill out their name, email, and work item details.

## Review work items in Intake

Once users submit the form, you’ll see their work item in your project's **Intake** section. From here, you can choose to accept the work item and move it into your project workflow or reject it if it doesn’t fit your current priorities—just like any other Intake work item.

This feature makes it easier to collect external feedback and handle work item submissions efficiently without giving outside users direct access to your project.
