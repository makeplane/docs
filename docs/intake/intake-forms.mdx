Now, you can easily gather bug reports, feature requests, or support tickets from external users, all by sharing a simple form link. 

## Enable Intake Forms
Head to your Project settings and toggle on the **Forms** option under the **Features** tab. This will generate a unique URL for collecting Intake issues. If the URL ever gets compromised, you can regenerate it by clicking **Renew**, ensuring only the right people can submit issues.

## Share the link

Share the link with anyone who needs to submit an issue. They’ll land on a simple form where they can fill out their name, email, and issue details.

## Review issues in Intake
Once users submit the form, you’ll see their issue in your project's **Intake** section. From here, you can choose to accept the issue and move it into your project workflow or reject it if it doesn’t fit your current priorities—just like any other Intake issue.

This feature makes it easier to collect external feedback and handle issue submissions efficiently without giving outside users direct access to your project.
