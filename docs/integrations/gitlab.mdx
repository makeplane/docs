Integrating GitLab with Plane allows you to sync your development workflow seamlessly by linking GitLab merge requests with Plane work items. This connection enables automated updates and enhances collaboration between developers and project managers.

Plane supports integration with:

- **GitLab.com**   
The standard cloud-hosted GitLab service

- **GitLab Self-managed**   
Self-hosted GitLab instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your GitLab account, link GitLab projects to Plane, and configure pull request automation.

## Set up GitLab integration

:::danger[Self-hosted Plane instance (Commercial Edition)]
If you're running a self-hosted instance of Plane, you'll need to set up a few extra configurations to get GitLab integration working. Check out the [setup guide](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab) first before diving into the steps on this page.
:::

To get started, you'll need to connect your GitLab account, organization, and repositories with Plane. Follow the steps below to complete the setup:

1. [Connect your GitLab organization](/integrations/gitlab#connect-gitlab-organization)
2. [Connect GitLab project](/integrations/gitlab#connect-gitlab-project)
3. [Connect Plane project](/integrations/gitlab#connect-plane-project)

### Connect GitLab organization

Link your GitLab organization to your Plane workspace to start syncing repositories. This step is crucial for enabling the full range of GitLab-Plane integration.

  <TabItem value="gitlab-self-managed" label="GitLab Self-managed">
  :::danger[Plane Cloud and self-hosted instances]

  Before you can integrate with GitLab Self-managed, you must first set up the necessary configurations in your GitLab instance. This is required for both Plane Cloud and self-hosted users.

  Follow this [setup guide](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab?edition=gitlab-self-managed) first before diving into the steps on this section.
  :::

  1. Navigate to [Workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#access-workspace-settings) in Plane.
  2. On the right pane, select **Integrations**.
  3. Find the **GitLab Self-managed** integration and click **Configure**.
  4. In the **Connect Organization** section, click **Connect**.
      
      ![Connect GitLab Enterprise organization](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab/connect-gitlab-self-managed.webp#hero)
  5. Fill the form with the details of your GitLab self-managed instance and click **Connect**.

  6. On the GitLab app installation page, choose the organization you want to connect.
  7. Select whether you want to sync all repositories or pick specific ones.
  8. Click **Install** to finalize the connection.
  9. After authorization, you’ll be redirected back to Plane, where your GitLab organization will appear as connected.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this stage, your GitLab account is linked to Plane, but you still need to connect specific GitLab projects to Plane projects.


### Connect GitLab project

Connecting a GitLab project allows Plane to receive updates from that project via webhooks. These webhooks are essential for GitLab merge request automation.

![Connect GitLab project](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab/connect-gitlab-project.webp#hero)

To connect a GitLab project:

1. In the **GitLab Project Connections** section, click **Add**.

2. Select the **GitLab Project** you want to link.

3. Click **Continue** to confirm the selection.

Once connected, the GitLab project will be listed in the UI, confirming the integration.

### Connect Plane project

After linking a GitLab project, the next step is to associate it with a Plane project. This connection ensures that Plane work items can be updated automatically based on GitLab merge request activities.

![Connect Plane project](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab/connect-plane-project.webp#hero)

1. Select the **Plane Project** you want to connect.

2. In the **Pull Request Automation** section, set up rules for how Plane should update work item states based on merge request lifecycle events.

3. Once configured, you will see the project connection appear in the **Plane Project Connections** section.

## Configure PR state automation

Pull requests (PRs) are also synchronized with Plane to ensure work item tracking remains accurate throughout the development lifecycle.

To automate pull request state changes with Plane work items:

1. Reference Plane work items in your GitLab PR title or description using the appropriate format. See [Reference formats](#reference-formats) below.
2. Automatic state updates will move the work item state in Plane based on the GitLab PR state defined in your mapping.

#### Reference formats
There are two ways to reference Plane work items in your GitLab PRs:

##### With brackets [WEB-344] - State automation

- Links the work item to the PR
- Adds a comment from Plane App showing linked work items
- Automatically updates the work item state based on PR state changes (as configured in your PR state mapping)

##### Without brackets WEB-344 - Link only

- Links the work item to the PR as a reference
- Adds a comment from Plane App showing referenced work items
- Does not trigger automatic state updates

*Example*
```bash
PR Title: [WEB-344] Add user authentication feature
PR Description: Implements login functionality for WEB-345
```

In this example:
- WEB-344 will be fully automated (state changes with PR state)
- WEB-345 will be linked as a reference only (no state automation)

### PR lifecycle mapping

The lifecycle of a pull request can be mapped to workflow states in Plane. The following PR states are available for mapping:

- A draft PR is created.
- A PR is opened.
- A review is requested.
- The PR is approved and ready to be merged.
- The PR is successfully merged.
- The PR is closed without merging.

### Work item backlinks in pull requests

When a PR references Plane work items, Plane will post a confirmation comment on the pull request, ensuring visibility into which issues are linked.

## Sync issues

With the GitLab integration set up, you can sync issues between Plane and GitLab at the project level. This ensures GitLab issues and Plane work items stay synchronized within your configured GitLab Projects and Plane projects.

### Add project work item sync
Once GitLab is connected to Plane, workspace admins can link GitLab Projects with Plane projects.

1. Navigate to the **Project Issue Sync** section under **Integrations**.
2. Click the (+) button to create a new sync mapping.
   
   ![Sync project to GitLab](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/sync-project-github.webp#hero)
3. In the modal that appears, configure the following:
   1. **Plane project**  
      Select the Plane project you want to sync with.
   2. **GitLab Project**  
      Choose the GitLab Project to connect.
   3. **Project issue sync**  
      Map GitLab issue states to Plane states:
      - Issue Open → Select a Plane state (e.g., Todo)
      - Issue Closed → Select a Plane state (e.g., Done)
   4. **Select issue sync direction**  
      Choose how issues should sync:
      - Unidirectional → Sync issues from GitLab to Plane only.
         :::warning
         This will overwrite Plane work item content with GitLab issue data.
         :::
      - Bidirectional → Sync issues both ways between GitLab and Plane.

      ![Sync direction](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/sync-direction.webp#hero)
   5. Click **Start Sync**.

All configured project issue syncs will appear in a list where you can edit or remove them as needed.

### Sync issues to Plane
After configuring project work item sync, you can link existing GitLab issues into your Plane project.

#### GitLab → Plane

1. In your GitLab project, add the `Plane` label to any issue you want to sync.
   
   ![Add Plane label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-plane-label.webp#hero)
2. The issue will automatically be created as a work item in the linked Plane project.
3. Plane posts a comment on the GitLab issue with a link to the newly created work item, confirming the connection.
   
   ![Synced issue from GitLab](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/synced-issue-from-github.webp#hero)
4. The work item in Plane will include a link back to the original GitLab issue.
   
   ![Creates issue in Plane](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/creates-plane-issue.webp#hero)

### Sync work items to GitLab
If you have existing work items in Plane that you want to sync to GitLab, you can do so using labels.

#### Plane → GitLab

1. In your Plane project, add the `gitlab` label to any work item you want to sync.
   
   ![Add gitlab label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-github-label.webp#hero)
2. A new issue will automatically be created in the linked GitLab project.
   
   ![Creates issue in GitLab](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/create-gitlab-issue.webp#hero)
3. The GitLab issue will be linked back to the Plane work item.
4. Future updates will sync according to your configured sync direction (unidirectional or bidirectional).

### How issue syncing works

#### State synchronization

- When a GitLab issue is opened or closed, the corresponding Plane work item automatically moves to the mapped state.
- With bidirectional sync enabled, state changes in Plane work items will also update the GitLab issue status (open/closed).

#### Creating synced issues

- Issues created in GitLab (within a synced project) are automatically created in the linked Plane project.
- With bidirectional sync enabled, work items created in Plane (with the sync configured) are also created in GitLab.

#### Continuous updates

- All synced properties (title, description, labels, comments, etc.) update automatically based on your sync direction settings.
- See [What gets synced?](#what-gets-synced) for detailed information on property-level sync behavior

### What gets synced?

:::warning[important]
In unidirectional sync mode (GitLab → Plane only), data from GitLab issues will overwrite corresponding data in Plane. Changes made in Plane will not sync back to GitLab unless you enable Bidirectional sync in your integration settings.

Here’s what syncs automatically between Plane and GitLab:
