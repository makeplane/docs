GitHub integration lets you connect any GitHub repository to a Plane project, enabling seamless bi-directional synchronization of issues between Plane and GitHub. This means you can track issues, changes, and updates across both platforms, making collaboration easier for teams managing code and tasks simultaneously.

With this integration, you can:

- Automatically sync issues created in Plane to the connected GitHub repository.
- Reflect changes like issue status updates or closures from GitHub back to Plane.
- Manage GitHub issues and pull requests directly from Plane, creating a streamlined workflow.

## Setup GitHub integration

### Connect GitHub organization

1. Navigate to [Workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) in Plane.
2. On the right pane, select **Integrations**.
3. Find  the **GitHub** integration and click **Configure**.
4. In the **Connect Organization** section, click **Connect**.
5. On the GitHub app installation page, choose the organization you want to connect.
6. Decide whether to connect all repositories or select specific ones.
7. Click **Install** to finalize the connection.
8. After authenticating, you'll be redirected back to Plane, where your GitHub organization will appear as connected. 

### Connect personal GitHub account

Connecting your personal GitHub account to Plane allows you to post comments on GitHub issues and pull requests directly from Plane. When this connection is enabled, comments made in Plane will appear in GitHub under your GitHub user account. If you haven't connected your personal account, comments will be posted as Plane GitHub App or your custom GitHub app name.

#### For Workspace Admins

1. In the **Connect personal account** section under **Integrations**, click **Connect**.
2. Review the required permissions GitHub requests and authorize.

:::tip
Only one Workspace Admin can connect their personal GitHub account via Workspace Settings. Other Admins and Members can connect theirs from [Profile Settings](/integrations/github#for-workspace-members).
:::

#### For Workspace Members

1. Go to [Profile settings](/core-concepts/account/settings).
2. Select the **Connections** tab in the sidebar. 
3. Choose the workspace where you want to connect your GitHub personal account.
4. Click **Connect** in the GitHub section, which will redirect you to GitHub for authentication.
    :::info
    If your workspace doesn’t have GitHub integration enabled, you won’t be able to connect your personal account. In this case, contact your Workspace Admin.
    :::
5. Once connected, you'll see your GitHub account listed as connected in Plane.

### Add repository mappings

Once GitHub is connected to Plane, workspace admins can map repositories to Plane projects. This mapping ensures proper syncing of issues and updates between GitHub and Plane.

1. Go to the **Repository Mapping** section under **Integrations**.
2. Click **Add** to create a new mapping.
3. In the modal that appears, select:
    - The GitHub repository you want to sync.
    - The Plane project to map it to.
    - The Plane states to map the state of the pull requests. 
4. Click **Continue**.

All active mappings will be displayed in a list, where you can edit or remove them as needed.

## Use GitHub integration in Plane
Once you've set up the GitHub integration, you can start syncing issues between Plane and GitHub. This integration ensures that updates in one platform reflect in the other, reducing manual effort and keeping your development workflow organized.

### Sync Issues between Plane and GitHub
Plane supports bi-directional, label-based issue syncing with GitHub, meaning that:

- Adding the `GitHub` label to an issue in Plane will sync it to GitHub.
- Adding the `Plane` label to an issue in GitHub will create and sync the issue in Plane.

### What gets synced?

Once an issue is synced between Plane and GitHub, the following properties are updated automatically:

|Property	     |Sync direction                           |Notes
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Title	|Both ways|	Updates in either platform reflect in the other.|
|Description	|Both ways|	Content remains consistent between Plane and GitHub.|
Assignees	Both ways	Assigned users are mapped based on the initial setup. If a user isn’t mapped, the assignee field may be left empty.
Labels	Both ways	Labels sync between platforms. If a label doesn’t exist in Plane, it will be created (and vice versa).
States	GitHub → Plane	State mapping follows the configuration defined during setup. Changes in Plane do not update GitHub states.
Comments	Both ways	Comments sync between platforms with source attribution. If the commenter isn’t mapped to a Plane user, the comment appears as posted by the GitHub Bot.
Mentions	Both ways	Mentioned users sync if they are mapped; otherwise, a GitHub profile link is included.
Issue Links	GitHub → Plane	Any issue references in GitHub descriptions or comments will be replaced with a direct link to the corresponding Plane issue.
Link Backs	Plane → GitHub	When an issue is synced, Plane posts a link back to the GitHub issue, confirming the connection.
Working with Pull Requests
Pull requests (PRs) are also synchronized with Plane to ensure issue tracking remains accurate throughout the development lifecycle.

Closing References and Auto-Updates
When a pull request includes closing references to GitHub issues (e.g., closes #14 #15), any linked Plane issues will automatically update with the PR link. If the PR is merged or closed, the Plane issue state updates based on the configured workflow.

Magic Words for Issue References
You can use specific keywords in GitHub pull requests to manage how Plane issues are updated.

Closing References: These mark issues as resolved when the PR is merged or closed.

Keywords: close, closes, closed, closing, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved, complete, completes, completed.
Non-Closing References: These maintain state mappings but do not mark issues as done when the PR is merged.

Keywords: ref, references, reference to, part of, related to.
PR Lifecycle Mapping
The lifecycle of a pull request can be mapped to workflow states in Plane. The following PR states are available for mapping:

DRAFT_MR_OPENED → When a draft PR is created.
MR_OPENED → When a PR is opened.
MR_REVIEW_REQUESTED → When a review is requested.
MR_READY_FOR_MERGE → When the PR is approved and ready to be merged.
MR_MERGED → When the PR is successfully merged.
MR_CLOSED → When the PR is closed without merging.
Issue Link Backs in Pull Requests
When a PR references Plane issues (using closing or non-closing reference keywords), Plane will post a confirmation comment on the pull request, ensuring visibility into which issues are linked.

Summary
With GitHub integration, Plane keeps your issues and PRs in sync, making project tracking more efficient. Whether you're syncing issue updates, mapping PR references, or managing workflows, this integration ensures that both platforms remain in harmony.
