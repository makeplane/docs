GitHub integration lets you connect any GitHub repository to a Plane project, enabling seamless bi-directional synchronization of issues between Plane and GitHub. This means you can track issues, changes, and updates across both platforms, making collaboration easier for teams managing code and tasks simultaneously.

With this integration, you can:

- Automatically sync issues created in Plane to the connected GitHub repository.
- Reflect changes like issue status updates or closures from GitHub back to Plane.
- Manage GitHub issues and pull requests, creating a streamlined workflow.

## Setup GitHub integration
Follow the steps below to complete the setup:
1. [Connect your GitHub organization](/integrations/github#connect-github-organization)  
2. [Connect your personal GitHub account](/integrations/github#connect-personal-github-account)  
3. [Add repository mappings](/integrations/github#add-repository-mappings)

### Connect GitHub organization
Link your workspace to a GitHub organization to sync repositories.
![Connect GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/connect-github.webp#center)

1. Navigate to [Workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) in Plane.
2. On the right pane, select **Integrations**.
3. Find  the **GitHub** integration and click **Configure**.
4. In the **Connect Organization** section, click **Connect**.
5. On the GitHub app installation page, choose the organization you want to connect.
6. Decide whether to connect all repositories or select specific ones.
7. Click **Install** to finalize the connection.
8. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Plane, where your GitHub organization will appear as connected. 

### Connect personal GitHub account

Enable commenting on issues and pull requests from Plane using your GitHub identity. 

When this connection is enabled, comments made in Plane will appear in GitHub under your GitHub user account, else comments will be posted as `Plane GitHub App` or your custom GitHub app name.

#### Workspace Admin

![Connect personal account](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/connect-personal-account.webp#center)

1. In the **Connect personal account** section under **Integrations**, click **Connect**.
2. Review the required permissions GitHub requests and authorize.

:::info
Only one Workspace Admin can connect their personal GitHub account via Workspace Settings. Other Admins and Members can connect theirs from [Profile Settings](/integrations/github#workspace-members).
:::

#### Workspace Members
![Connect member personal account](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/connect-personal-account-member.webp#center)

1. Go to [Profile settings](/core-concepts/account/settings).
2. Select the **Connections** tab in the sidebar. 
3. Choose the workspace where you want to connect your GitHub personal account.
4. Click **Connect** in the GitHub section, which will redirect you to GitHub for authentication.
    :::info
    If your workspace doesn’t have GitHub integration enabled, you won’t be able to connect your personal account. In this case, contact your Workspace Admin.
    :::
5. Once connected, you'll see your GitHub account listed as connected in Plane.

### Add repository mappings

Once GitHub is connected to Plane, workspace admins can map repositories to Plane projects. This mapping ensures proper syncing of issues and pull requests between GitHub and Plane.
![Repository mapping](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/repository-mapping.webp#center)

1. Go to the **Repository Mapping** section under **Integrations**.
2. Click **Add** to create a new mapping.
![Sync repo and project](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/sync-repo-and-project.webp#center)
3. In the modal that appears, select:
    - The GitHub repository you want to sync.
    - The Plane project to map it to.
    - The Plane states to map the state of the pull requests. 
4. Click **Continue**.

All linked repositories will be displayed in a list, where you can edit or remove them as needed.

## Sync issues

Once you've set up the GitHub integration, you can start syncing issues between Plane and GitHub. Plane supports bi-directional, label-based issue syncing with GitHub.

### Github -> Plane
1. Add the `Plane` label to an issue in GitHub to create and sync the issue in Plane.
  ![Add Plane label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-plane-label.webp#center)
2. Plane posts a link back to the GitHub issue, confirming the connection.
  ![Synced issue from GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/synced-issue-from-github.webp#center)
3. A new issue is created in Plane with a link to the GitHub issue. 
  ![Creates issue in Plane](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/creates-plane-issue.webp#center)

### Plane -> GitHub

1. Add the `GitHub` label to an issue in Plane to sync it to GitHub.
  ![Add GitHub label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-github-label.webp#center)
2. A new issue is created in Github.
  ![Creates issue in GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/create-github-issue.webp#center)
3. The GitHub issue is also linked back in Plane. 

### What gets synced?

Once an issue is synced between Plane and GitHub, the following properties and elements are updated automatically.

|Property&nbsp;&nbsp;    |Sync&nbsp;direction&nbsp;&nbsp;                           |Notes
| ------------| ----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|Title	|Both ways|	Updates in either platform reflect in the other.|
|Description	|Both ways|	Content remains consistent between Plane and GitHub.|
|Assignees	|Both ways|	Assigned users are mapped based on the initial setup. If a user isn’t mapped, the assignee field may be left empty.|
|Labels|	Both ways| If a Label doesn’t exist in Plane, it will be created (and vice versa).|
|States|	GitHub → Plane| Changes in Plane do not update GitHub states. However, if an issue is closed in GitHub, it automatically moves to the Done state in Plane.|
|Comments	|Both ways	|Comments sync between platforms with source attribution. If the commenter isn’t mapped to a Plane user, the comment appears as posted by the GitHub Bot. See [Connect personal GitHub account](/integrations/github#connect-personal-github-account) for more info.|
|Mentions	|Both ways	|Mentioned users sync if they are mapped; otherwise, a GitHub profile link is included.|
|Issue links|	GitHub → Plane|	Any issue references in GitHub descriptions or comments will be displayed in Plane with a direct link to the issue including the repository name and owner.|

## Sync pull requests 
Pull requests (PRs) are also synchronized with Plane to ensure issue tracking remains accurate throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Closing references and auto-updates
When a pull request includes closing references to GitHub issues (e.g., closes #14 #15), any linked Plane issues will automatically update with the PR link. If the PR is merged or closed, the Plane issue state updates based on the configured workflow in [Repository mappings](/integrations/github#add-repository-mappings).

#### Magic words for issue references
You can use specific keywords in GitHub pull requests to manage how Plane issues are updated.

- **Closing references**  
These mark issues as resolved when the PR is merged or closed.  
**Keywords**  
`close`, `closes`, `closed`, `closing`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`, `complete`, `completes`, `completed`.

- **Non-closing references**  
These maintain state mappings but do not mark issues as done when the PR is merged.  
**Keywords**  
`ref`, `references`, `reference to`, `part of`, `related to`.

#### PR lifecycle mapping
The lifecycle of a pull request can be [mapped](/integrations/github#add-repository-mappings) to workflow states in Plane. The following PR states are available for mapping:

- `DRAFT_MR_OPENED` → When a draft PR is created.
- `MR_OPENED` → When a PR is opened.
- `MR_REVIEW_REQUESTED` → When a review is requested.
- `MR_READY_FOR_MERGE` → When the PR is approved and ready to be merged.
- `MR_MERGED` → When the PR is successfully merged.
- `MR_CLOSED` → When the PR is closed without merging.

#### Issue backlinks in pull requests
When a PR references Plane issues (using closing or non-closing reference keywords), Plane will post a confirmation comment on the pull request, ensuring visibility into which issues are linked.

With the GitHub integration, Plane keeps your issues and PRs in sync, making project tracking more efficient. Whether you're syncing issue updates, mapping PR references, or managing workflows, this integration ensures that both platforms remain in harmony.
