GitHub integration allows you to connect any GitHub repository to a Plane project, enabling cross-synchronization of issues between Plane and GitHub in both directions.

By connecting a GitHub repository to a Plane project, you can easily track issues and changes in both platforms. This allows for a more streamlined workflow, as users can manage their GitHub issues and pull requests from within the Plane platform.

The bi-directional synchronization means that changes made in either platform will be reflected in the other. For example, if a user creates a new issue in Plane, it will automatically be synced with the corresponding repository in GitHub. Similarly, if you close an issue in GitHub, it will be reflected in Plane as well.

## Connect GitHub organization

1. Go to [Workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings).
2. Select **Integrations** on the right pane.
3. Click **Configure** on the **GitHub** integration.
4. Click the **Connect** button in the **Connect Organization** box.
5. In the app installation page, select the organization you want to connect. 
6. Here, you choose to connect all the repositories or choose specific repositoryies you want to connect to. 
7. Click **Install**. 
8. Post authentication, you'll be redirected back to Plane and will see your GitHub organization connected. 

## Connect personal account

You can also connect your personal Github account to Plane, this will enable Plane to post comment on Github on behalf of you, which is used in Issue and pull request comments, when a user posts a comment to the pull request or issue, the message will be posted back to Github, now if the user who is posting the message has not connected his/her personal account, the message will be sent as `Plane Github App` or the name of your Github App, else the comment will be posted as the user itself.

### Workspace Admins

1. Click **Connect** in the **Connect personal account** box. 
2. Github will require some permissions required from the user account, review the permissions and allow.

1. Install and authenticate GitHub Sync

:::tipObviously, GitHub Sync requires you to authenticate with your account to add the Plane GitHub application. Also, if you want to use GitHub Sync in an organization, you may need to ask an admin to allow Plane to access the organization, or do that yourself: Organization settings => GitHub Apps (enter sudo mode) => approve the request for the Plane integration.:::
