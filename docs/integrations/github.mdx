GitHub integration with Plane allows seamless synchronization between your GitHub repositories and Plane projects. By linking the two, your issues and pull requests stay updated across both platforms, enhancing collaboration and streamlining your workflow. Whether you're managing code, tasks, or both, this integration ensures your team stays in sync without the hassle of switching between platforms.

Plane supports integration with:

- **GitHub Cloud**  
The standard cloud-hosted GitHub service

- **GitHub Enterprise Server**   
Self-hosted GitHub instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

### Connect personal GitHub account

This step allows you to make comments on issues and pull requests in GitHub through your Plane account, using your personal GitHub identity.

When this connection is enabled, comments made in Plane will appear in GitHub under your GitHub user account, else comments will be posted as `Plane GitHub App` or your custom GitHub app name.

#### From Workspace settings

Workspace admins can connect their personal GitHub accounts from Workspace settings.

![Connect personal account](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/connect-personal-account.webp#hero)

1. In the **Connect personal account** section under **Integrations**, click **Connect**.
2. Review the required permissions GitHub requests and authorize.
3. After granting permissions, you’ll see the status updated to show that your personal account is connected.

:::info
Only one Workspace Admin can connect their GitHub account via Workspace Settings. Others can connect their accounts through [Profile Settings](/integrations/github#from-profile-settings).
:::

#### From Profile settings

If you don’t have admin access, you can still connect your personal GitHub account through your profile settings.

![Connect member personal account](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/connect-personal-account-member.webp#hero)

1. Go to [Profile settings](/core-concepts/account/settings).
2. Select the **Connections** tab in the sidebar.
3. Choose the workspace where you want to connect your GitHub personal account.
4. Click **Connect** in the GitHub section, which will redirect you to GitHub for authentication.
   :::info
   If your workspace doesn’t have GitHub integration enabled, you won’t be able to connect your personal account. In this case, contact your Workspace Admin.
   :::
5. Once connected, your GitHub account will be listed in Plane.

## Sync issues

With the GitHub integration set up, you can sync issues between Plane and GitHub at the project level. This ensures GitHub issues and Plane work items stay synchronized within your configured repositories and projects.

### Add project work item sync
Once GitHub is connected to Plane, workspace admins can link GitHub repositories with Plane projects.

1. Navigate to the **Project Issue Sync** section under **Integrations**.
2. Click the (+) button to create a new sync mapping.
   
   ![Sync project to GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/sync-project-github.webp#hero)
3. In the modal that appears, configure the following:
   1. **Plane project**  
      Select the Plane project you want to sync with.
   2. **GitHub repository**  
      Choose the GitHub repository to connect.
   3. **Project issue sync**  
      Map GitHub issue states to Plane states:
      - Issue Open → Select a Plane state (e.g., Todo)
      - Issue Closed → Select a Plane state (e.g., Done)
   4. **Select issue sync direction**  
      Choose how issues should sync:
      - Unidirectional → Sync issues from GitHub to Plane only.
         :::warning
         This will overwrite Plane work item content with GitHub issue data.
         :::
      - Bidirectional → Sync issues both ways between GitHub and Plane.

      ![Sync direction](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/sync-direction.webp#hero)
   5. Click **Start Sync**.

All configured project issue syncs will appear in a list where you can edit or remove them as needed.

### Sync issues to Plane
After configuring project work item sync, you can link existing GitHub issues into your Plane project.

#### GitHub → Plane

1. In your GitHub repository, add the `Plane` label to any issue you want to sync.
   
   ![Add Plane label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-plane-label.webp#hero)
2. The issue will automatically be created as a work item in the linked Plane project.
3. Plane posts a comment on the GitHub issue with a link to the newly created work item, confirming the connection.
   
   ![Synced issue from GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/synced-issue-from-github.webp#hero)
4. The work item in Plane will include a link back to the original GitHub issue.
   
   ![Creates issue in Plane](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/creates-plane-issue.webp#hero)

### Sync work items to GitHub
If you have existing work items in Plane that you want to sync to GitHub, you can do so using labels.

#### Plane → GitHub

1. In your Plane project, add the `GitHub` label to any work item you want to sync.
   
   ![Add GitHub label](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/add-github-label.webp#hero)
2. A new issue will automatically be created in the linked GitHub repository.
   
   ![Creates issue in GitHub](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/create-github-issue.webp#hero)
3. The GitHub issue will be linked back to the Plane work item.
4. Future updates will sync according to your configured sync direction (unidirectional or bidirectional).

### How issue syncing works

#### State synchronization

- When a GitHub issue is opened or closed, the corresponding Plane work item automatically moves to the mapped state.
- With bidirectional sync enabled, state changes in Plane work items will also update the GitHub issue status (open/closed).

#### Creating synced issues

- Issues created in GitHub (within a synced repository) are automatically created in the linked Plane project.
- With bidirectional sync enabled, work items created in Plane (with the sync configured) are also created in GitHub.

#### Continuous updates

- All synced properties (title, description, assignees, labels, comments, etc.) update automatically based on your sync direction settings.
- See [What gets synced?](#what-gets-synced) for detailed information on property-level sync behavior

### What gets synced?

:::warning[important]
By default, syncing is unidirectional (GitHub → Plane only). Data from GitHub issues will overwrite corresponding data in Plane. Changes made in Plane will not sync back to GitHub unless you enable Bidirectional sync in your integration settings.
:::

Here’s what syncs automatically between Plane and GitHub:

## Configure PR state automation

Pull requests (PRs) are also synchronized with Plane to ensure work item tracking remains accurate throughout the development lifecycle.

### Add pull request mapping

Once GitHub is connected to Plane, workspace admins can configure pull request state mapping for Plane projects. This ensures PR states automatically sync with work item states in the mapped project.

1. Navigate to the **Pull request state mapping** section.
2. Click the (+) button to create a new mapping.
   
   ![Repository mapping](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/pr-state-mapping.webp#hero)
3. In the modal that appears, configure the following:
   - **Plane project**  
     Select the Plane project where PR state automation should be enabled.
   - **Pull request automation**
      Map GitHub pull request states to Plane work item states
   
   ![Sync repo and project](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/github/pr-automation.webp#hero)
4. Click **Save**.

All configured pull request state mappings will appear in a list where you can edit or remove them as needed.

### Set up PR automation

To automate pull request state changes with Plane work items:

1. Configure PR state mapping for your Plane project to enable PR state automation. See [Add pull request mapping](#add-pull-request-mapping).
2. Reference Plane work items in your GitHub PR title or description using the appropriate format. See [Reference formats](#reference-formats) below.
3. Automatic state updates will move the work item state in Plane based on the GitHub PR state defined in your mapping.

#### Reference formats
There are two ways to reference Plane work items in your GitHub PRs:

##### With brackets [WEB-344] - State automation

- Links the work item to the PR
- Adds a comment from Plane App showing linked work items
- Automatically updates the work item state based on PR state changes (as configured in your PR state mapping)

##### Without brackets WEB-344 - Link only

- Links the work item to the PR as a reference
- Adds a comment from Plane App showing referenced work items
- Does not trigger automatic state updates

*Example*
```bash
PR Title: [WEB-344] Add user authentication feature
PR Description: Implements login functionality for WEB-345
```

In this example:
- WEB-344 will be fully automated (state changes with PR state)
- WEB-345 will be linked as a reference only (no state automation)

### PR lifecycle mapping

The lifecycle of a pull request can be [mapped](#configure-pr-state-automation) to workflow states in Plane. The following PR states are available for mapping:

- A draft PR is created.
- A PR is opened.
- A review is requested.
- The PR is approved and ready to be merged.
- The PR is successfully merged.
- The PR is closed without merging.

### Issue backlinks in pull requests

When a PR references Plane work items, Plane will post a confirmation comment on the pull request, ensuring visibility into which issues are linked.
