Integrating Slack with Plane allows your team to streamline communication and stay updated on your projects, directly from within Slack. Whether you're syncing threads, receiving updates, or collaborating in real-time, this integration brings the power of Slack and Plane together for a more connected workflow.

This guide will walk you through how to set up and connect your Slack account to Plane.

## Set up Slack integration

:::danger[Self-hosted instances (Commercial Edition)]
If you're running a self-hosted instance of Plane, you'll need to set up a few extra configurations to get Slack integration working. Check out the [setup guide](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/integrations/slack) first before diving into the steps on this page.
:::

Follow the steps below to complete the setup:

1. [Connect your Slack Workspace](/integrations/slack#connect-slack-workspace)
2. [Connect your personal Slack account](/integrations/slack#connect-personal-slack-account)

### Connect Slack Workspace

To get started, you need to connect your Slack workspace to Plane.

![Connect Slack](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/connect-slack.webp#hero)

1. Navigate to [Workspace Settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#access-workspace-settings) in Plane.
2. On the right pane, select **Integrations**.
3. Find the **Slack** integration and click **Configure**.
4. Click the **Install** button. This will redirect you to Slack’s authentication page. Slack will ask you to review the permissions it needs to integrate with Plane. Make sure to allow them.
5. After allowing permissions, you’ll be redirected back to Plane. You should now see that your Slack workspace is successfully connected.

That's it! Your Slack workspace is now integrated with Plane.

### Connect personal Slack account

For a more personalized experience, you can connect your personal Slack account. This is particularly useful for features like Thread Sync. When Thread Sync is enabled, any messages posted to a work item will be sent back to Slack. If you're connected, it will show your name as the sender. If you're not connected, the message will appear as coming from the Plane Bot or the name of your Slack bot.

![Connect personal account](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/slack-connected.webp#hero)

#### From Workspace settings

Workspace admins can connect their personal Slack accounts from Workspace settings.

1. In the **Connect your personal account** section under **Integrations**, click **Connect**.
2. Slack will ask for permission to integrate with Plane. Review and allow the necessary permissions.
3. After granting permissions, you’ll see the status updated to show that your personal account is connected.

:::info
Only one Workspace Admin can connect their personal Slack account via Workspace Settings. Other Admins and Members can connect theirs from [Profile settings](/integrations/slack#from-workspace-settings).
:::

#### From Profile settings

If you don’t have admin access, you can still connect your personal Slack account through your profile settings.

1. Head to the [Profile settings](/core-concepts/account/settings) page in Plane.
2. Select the **Connections** tab on the sidebar.
3. In the dropdown menu, select the Plane workspace you want to connect your personal account to.
   
   ![Connect personal account member](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/connect-personal-account-member.webp#hero)
4. Click **Connect** in the Slack section, which will redirect you to Slack to complete the connection.
   :::info
   If your workspace doesn’t have Slack integration enabled, you won’t be able to connect your personal account. In this case, contact your Workspace Admin.
   :::
5. Once your account is connected, you’ll see the status update to reflect that your personal Slack account is successfully integrated.

## Use the Slack integration

Now that you’ve connected Slack to Plane, let’s explore what you can do with this integration. We built this to reduce the constant back-and-forth between Plane and Slack—so instead of switching between tools to create work items, update statuses, or share links, you can do it all from Slack.

### Create work items from Slack

There are two easy ways to create issues from Slack, depending on your workflow: using the message shortcut or the `/plane` command. Any updates in Plane to fields like State, Assignee, or others will automatically reflect in the linked Slack thread.

#### Message shortcut

If a message sparks an action item, turn it into a Plane work item in just a few clicks:

1. Hover over any message in Slack.
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Create an Issue**.
   
   ![Thread sync](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/create-plane-issue.webp#hero)
3. A modal will open where you can select the project.
4. Add a title and description (the original message is pre-filled).
5. Assign Labels, State, Priority, and Assignee.
6. Enable Thread Sync (optional). When enabled, Thread Sync keeps your conversation and Plane issue comments in sync. Anything you say in the Slack thread appears in the Plane work item comments, and vice versa. It’s the easiest way to keep everyone aligned without repeating updates in two places.
7. Once you hit **Create Issue**, the issue gets added to the Backlog of your selected project, and a preview is posted in the Slack thread so everyone knows it's being tracked.

#### `/plane` command

The `/plane` command lets you create a work item on the fly, without referencing a specific message.

![Slash Plane command](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/slash-plane-command.webp#hero)

1. Type `/plane` in any Slack channel or DM.
2. A pop-up will appear where you can fill in work item details—title, description, state, labels, priority, and more.
3. Click **Submit**, and the work item is instantly created in Plane.

This is great for when an idea or task comes up mid-conversation—you can create the work item in just a couple of clicks without breaking your flow.

### Link work items to Slack threads

If a Plane work item already exists, and you want to connect it to a Slack thread (for updates, visibility, or comments), just use the **Link Work Item** shortcut. Here’s how:

1. Hover over the relevant Slack message or thread.
2. Click the three-dot menu adn select **Link Work Item**.
   
   ![Link Work Item](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/link-work-item.webp#hero)
3. In the modal, search for the work item by title or ID.
4. Select the right issue and hit **Link**.

That’s it. Now the thread and the work item are connected. Comments in the thread can sync to Plane (and vice versa, if **Thread Sync** is enabled on that issue), and the thread will display a rich preview of the linked work item.

This is perfect for situations where someone logs an issue in Plane but the conversation about it happens in Slack. Just link them up and avoid duplication.

### Add Plane to private Slack channels
When you use Plane in public Slack channels, it automatically adds the Plane bot to those channels. However, for private channels, you must manually add the bot before you can create or link work items.

Here's how to add Plane to your private channels:

1. Navigate to your private channel.
2. Open the channel settings.
3. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
4. Click **Add apps** in the **Apps** section.
5. Search for `Plane` in the app directory. You'll see the Plane app with the `/plane` slash command
6. Click *Add* next to the Plane app.

This will add the Plane bot to your private channel, and Slack will show you a confirmation message.

:::note
Only channel members with the right permissions can add apps to private channels. If you don't see the option to add apps, ask a channel admin or the channel creator to add Plane for you.
:::

Once you add Plane to your private channel, you can use all the same features you'd use in public channels - creating work items, linking existing ones, and getting rich link previews. The bot just needs that initial invitation to join your private conversation.

### Connect project to Slack channel

Stay on top of project updates without switching tabs. You can now link each Plane project to a default Slack channel to receive notifications whenever new work items are created.

![Connect project to Slack channel](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/connect-project-slack-channel.webp#hero)

To configure this:

1. Go to your [Workspace Settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#access-workspace-settings) in Plane.
2. Navigate to **Integrations > Slack**.
3. Click **Configure** on the Slack integration.
4. Under **Project Notifications**, click the **➕** button.
5. Select a Plane Project and the corresponding Slack Channel you’d like to connect.
6. Click Save.

Once set, Plane will automatically post updates to the selected Slack channel every time a new work item is created in that project keeping your team informed and your workflows connected.

### Link previews

When you share a Plane Issue, Cycle, or Module link in Slack, you’ll see a live preview of its details, including:

- **Issues**  
  Title, status, priority, assignee, and quick actions.
- **Cycles and Modules**  
  Progress percentage, active vs. completed work items, and key details.

#### Take actions from Slack

With link previews, you can interact with the work item directly from Slack.

![Link previews](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/slack/link-previews.webp#hero)

- Assign the work item to yourself.
- Change its state (e.g., move it to "In Progress").
- Add a comment.

This makes it easy to stay updated and take action without leaving Slack.

## Privacy and data handling

When you use the Slack integration with Plane, we take your privacy seriously. The integration only accesses the minimum permissions necessary to function properly, and we handle your data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://plane.so/legals/privacy-policy).

The integration may collect and process:
- Messages and threads you choose to sync with Plane work items
- Channel information for project notifications
- Basic user information for authentication and personalization

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and you can disconnect the integration at any time from your [Workspace Settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#access-workspace-settings) or [Profile settings](/core-concepts/account/settings).

By using these features, you can reduce context-switching and manage Plane work items directly from Slack—keeping your workflow smooth and efficient.
