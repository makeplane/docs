description: Use the Plane MCP server to integrate with Plane

## Introduction

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) (MCP) is a
standardized interface that enables AI models to communicate with external tools and
services. When combined with Server-Sent Events (SSE), it provides a powerful
mechanism for real-time data transfer between AI models and external systems.

:::tip Alpha
The Plane MCP Server is currently in **Alpha**. Some aspects of the API may change.
While MCP is standardized, it is also rapidly evolving. The Plane MCP Server aims to
provide a stable implementation for developers to build robust AI-powered
applications. Please send any issues to support@plane.so.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Plane MCP Server, ensure you have the following installed:

### Node.js and npm
- **Node.js**: Version 20 or later (LTS recommended)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js
- **npx**: Comes bundled with npm

You can verify your installation by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
npx --version
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

:::note
The MCP server uses `npx` to run the `mcp-remote` package, which handles the connection to Plane's MCP server. This is why Node.js and npx are required.

## Using the Plane MCP Server

Follow these steps to integrate with the Plane MCP Server.

### Claude.ai

- Open **Settings** from the sidebar on the web or desktop app.
- Scroll to the **Integrations** section and click **Add more**.
- Enter the Integration URL: `https://mcp.plane.so/sse`
- Click **Connect** to link your Plane workspace.

### Claude Desktop

Add Plane to [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) by
updating your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VSCode

Connect Plane to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server)
by editing your `.vscode.json` or `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` to open Windsurf settings
2. Navigate to **Cascade** > **MCP servers**
3. Select **Add Server** > **Add custom server**
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Zed

1. Press `Cmd + ,` to open Zed settings
2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "plane": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Activating the Plane MCP Server

After setup, when activating the server, you will be prompted in your browser to
connect your Plane workspace to the MCP server.

When prompted to authorize, click **Approve**.

Next, choose the workspace you want to connect, review the permissions, and click
**Accept**.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors**

If you encounter authentication issues, clear saved auth tokens:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```

**Connection Timeouts**

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Check if your firewall or proxy is blocking MCP connections
- Try using the HTTP endpoint instead of SSE if available

**WSL on Windows**

If you're using WSL on Windows and encountering errors, use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": ["npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse", "--transport sse-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Node.js Version**

Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. MCP servers require Node.js 18 or later.

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Verify your authentication credentials
2. Contact support at support@plane.so for Plane-specific issues
3. Check the [MCP community forums](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for general MCP issues

## Congrats!

You have successfully connected your Plane workspace to the MCP server!
