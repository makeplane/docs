Plane AI is an AI assistant that helps you interact with your Plane workspace using natural language. Instead of navigating through menus and filters, you can simply ask Plane AI questions about your projects, work items, and documentation in plain English.

Think of Plane AI as a knowledgeable team member who has instant access to all your project data. You can ask it to find specific issues, analyze project progress, search through documentation, or help you understand complex relationships between work items.

## What Plane AI cannot do (yet)

Plane AI is currently **read-only**. It cannot perform actions that modify your workspace:

- ❌ Execute automated task workflows.
- ❌ Handle bulk operations or routine project management tasks.

## How to use Plane AI

### Access Plane AI

Plane AI is accessible from the left sidebar (AI icon for a dedicated chat interface with recent history) or directly within a project's Work Items and Cycles pages (AI icon on the top right to start a new chat in a side panel without leaving your view).

![Plane AI chat project](https://media.docs.plane.so/pi-chat/pi-chat-project.webp#hero)

### Start a conversation

1. Type your question in the chat input at the bottom of the Plane AI interface.
2. Plane AI will process your query and provide a response.
3. You can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into the results.
4. Use `@mentions` for direct entity reference, for eg., "@WEB-4651 what's the status of this work item?"

### Attach files

Click the **attachment icon** in the chat input to upload files:
- Screenshots and images for visual context
- Documents for reference
- Error logs or data files for analysis

Plane AI can reference attachments in its responses and help you analyze the content.

### Use voice input

Click the **microphone icon** to speak your query instead of typing. Plane AI transcribes your speech and processes it as a text query, useful for:
- Quick queries on mobile
- Complex questions that are faster to speak
- Hands-free operation

### Create items with Plane AI

Plane AI can create work items, projects, cycles, and modules through natural language commands.

#### Create a work item

1. Ensure you have a project selected using the Focus selector.
2. Type a creation command describing what you want to create:
    ```
      Create a bug report for the login page crash
    ```
3. Plane AI processes your request and shows its thinking.
4. Once completed, the work item is created and you'll see a success confirmation with the work item ID.

The newly created work item will include:
- Automatically generated title based on your description
- AI-generated description summarizing the work item
- Appropriate work item type (bug, feature, etc.) inferred from your command
- Default project properties

:::tip
Be specific in your commands. Include details like priority, assignees, or descriptions to help Plane AI create more complete work items. For example: "Create a high-priority bug for the payment gateway timeout issue and assign it to the backend team."
:::

### Thread organization and management

- All conversations are saved and organized in persistent conversation threads.
- Automatic chat titling based on content.
- Mark important conversations as favorites for easy access.
- Search and revisit past conversations.
- Delete and rename chats with full management capabilities.

Conversational features

- Maintain context across multiple exchanges with multi-turn conversations.
- Support for markdown, code blocks, tables, and lists with rich formatting.
- Automatically create clickable links to work items and pages through entity linking.

### Workspace and project context

Notice the **Focus** selector at the bottom of the chat interface.
- Set your conversation scope to a specific workspace.
- Switch between different workspaces if you have access to multiple ones.
- Ensure Plane AI searches and analyzes data from the right context.
- Narrow context to individual projects when needed.

### Plane AI's reasoning and responses

Plane AI includes a **Show thinking** feature that reveals how it processes your queries.
- Click **Show thinking** to see Plane AI's step-by-step reasoning process.
- Watch as Plane AI understands your query, plans its approach, and executes database searches.
- This transparency helps you understand why Plane AI provides certain results and how to refine your questions.

Plane AI provides structured responses that may include:
- Direct answers with relevant data from live Plane databases.
- Tables and lists for organized information with complex filtering.
- Links to specific work items and pages with clickable references.
- Explanations of why certain results were included with reasoning.
- Aggregations and analytics that generate insights from project data.
- Relationship mapping showing connections between entities.

When Plane AI references work items, it will show you the title and provide clickable links to view them directly in Plane.

### Get better results

**Be specific about your needs**
- Instead of: "Show me issues"
- Try: "Show me high-priority bugs in the mobile app project from last month"

**Use natural language**
- "What tasks are overdue in my current sprint?"
- "Who has been working on authentication issues?"
- "Find documentation about setting up webhooks"

**Ask follow-up questions**
- Plane AI remembers your conversation context
- Build on previous queries: "Now show me only the ones assigned to Sarah"
- Ask for different formats: "Can you show this as a summary instead?"

### Sample queries to try

Based on the interface, here are some example questions you might ask:

**Personal work insights**
- "Who commented on my work items recently?"
- "What did I complete this week?"
- "What's the progress of work items in current active cycles?"

**Project analysis**
- "Show me all items in the backlog for this project"
- "What work is planned for the next sprint?"
- "Which items are ready for development?"

**Team coordination**
- "What's blocking our current sprint work?"
- "Show me overdue items across all projects"
- "Which team members need more work assigned?"

### Manage your conversations

- **Recent chats**: Access your conversation history from the **Recents** section in the sidebar.
- **New conversations**: Click "New chat" to start fresh when switching topics.
- **Contextual help**: Plane AI will suggest relevant follow-up questions based on your queries

### Response interactions

At the bottom of each Plane AI response, you'll find:
- **Thumbs up/down**: Rate the helpfulness of Plane AI's response.
- **Copy**: Copy the response text for use elsewhere.
- **Share**: Share the conversation or specific responses with team members.

## Platform availability

Plane AI works across all your devices:

- **Web interface**: Access Plane AI directly within your Plane workspace.
- **Mobile apps**: Native iOS and Android apps with full Plane AI functionality.
- **Sync across devices**: Your conversation history stays consistent everywhere.

## Privacy and permissions

Plane AI respects your Plane permissions and workspace boundaries:
- You can only access data you normally have permission to view.
- Conversations are scoped to your current workspace.
- Plane AI cannot see or access other workspaces you don't belong to.

## Tips for effective use

**Start broad, then narrow down**. Begin with general queries and use Plane AI's responses to refine your search:
1. "Show me recent bugs"
2. "Focus on the ones from the authentication module"
3. "Which of these are assigned to the backend team?"

**Use Plane AI for discovery**
- "What documentation exists about our API?"
- "Find all work items mentioning performance issues"
- "Show me pages related to user onboarding"

**Leverage context awareness**
Plane AI understands your project structure and relationships:
- "What's blocking the login feature work?"
- "Find related issues to PROJ-123"
- "Show me work items similar to this bug report"

If Plane AI doesn't understand your query or provides unexpected results:
- Try rephrasing your question with different terms
- Be more specific about timeframes, projects, or work item types
- Ask Plane AI to explain its reasoning: "Why did you include these results?"

Plane AI is continuously learning and improving. The more you use it, the better it becomes at understanding your team's specific needs and terminology.

## What's coming next

We're actively working on expanding Plane AI's capabilities:
- **Action execution**: Create and update work items through conversation
- **Advanced workflows**: Automate routine project management tasks
- **Voice interface**: Speak your queries instead of typing
- **Enhanced analytics**: Predictive insights and recommendations

Plane AI represents the future of project management, where natural conversation replaces complex interfaces, and your AI assistant helps you focus on what matters most: building great products.
