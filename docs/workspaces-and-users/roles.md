# Member roles

Every user in your workspace has a role that determines their access level and permissions. Plane uses three role types - Admin, Member, and Guest - each designed for different levels of involvement and responsibility.

## Types of roles

### Admin

**Workspace governance**  
Admins control the workspace itself - settings, members, features, and access. They determine what capabilities are available to all Members. It provide complete control for workspace owners and senior stakeholders who need to manage team structure and configuration. This centralized authority prevents configuration conflicts and maintains consistent workspace policies.

### Member

**Contributor autonomy**  
Members can do their work - create projects, manage work items, collaborate with the team - without needing administrative overhead. They see the full workspace membership (fostering transparency) and can discover public projects (encouraging collaboration), but cannot alter workspace structure or invite others. This separation keeps Members focused on execution rather than governance.

### Guest

**Controlled external access**  
Organizations frequently need to give clients, contractors, or stakeholders visibility into work without exposing the entire workspace or allowing them to be assigned tasks. Guests exist outside the workspace's core structure. They cannot see workspace members, settings, or the broader project landscape. Their access is project-specific and tightly scoped, ensuring external collaborators only interact with content relevant to them.

## When to use each role

**Choose Admin for:**

- Workspace owners
- Technical leads responsible for workspace governance
- People who need to manage team membership and workspace settings
- Anyone responsible for enabling features, configuring integrations, or managing billing

**Choose Member for:**

- Full-time team members who actively contribute to projects
- Internal collaborators who should have visibility into the workspace team
- Anyone who needs to create projects or access workspace features

**Choose Guest for:**

- External clients who need to review specific project deliverables
- Contractors contributing to particular work items via the Intake section
- Stakeholders who need visibility into specific projects without editing permissions
- Anyone who should remain isolated from the broader workspace structure and membership
