## Manage paid users

You can always reassign or adjust seats as your team’s needs change. Here’s how to add or remove paid seats:

1. Open your [workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) and navigate to the **Members** screen.
2. You’ll see a **Manage Seats** button.

Clicking this will give you two choices:

- **Add seats**  
  If you need more seats, click **Add seats**. A modal will appear where you can specify the number of additional paid seats you want to add. Once you’ve entered the number, click **Change**. You’ll be redirected to the Stripe payment portal to complete the payment for the new seats.

- **Remove unused seats**  
  Any paid seat that isn’t currently assigned to a user is considered unused and can be reassigned at any time. If you no longer need these unused seats and want to stop paying for them, click **Remove unused seats**. This will automatically remove all paid but unused seats from your workspace.
