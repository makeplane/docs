# Manage paid seats in your workspace

Manage the number of paid seats in your workspace to control your subscription costs. Seats determine how many Admins and Members you can have.

:::info
Guests don't count as paid seats. You get 5 Guest users per paid seat automatically.

## Remove unused seats

Remove unused seats to reduce your subscription cost. You can only remove seats that aren't currently assigned to members.

:::

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings > Members**.
2. Click **Manage Seats**.
3. Select **Remove unused seats**.

This removes all paid seats not currently assigned to Admins or Members.
