## How search works

Type your query and results appear instantly, organized by type. Use the tabs at the top to filter results:

- **All** - Shows everything across all categories
- **Projects** - Your workspace projects
- **Work items** -  Tasks across projects
- **Cycles** - Project cycles
- **Modules** - Project modules
- **Views** - Saved views
- **Pages** - Project pages
- **Epics** - Epics in projects
- **Teamspaces** - Teamspaces
- **Comments** - Work item comments

Each tab shows the number of matching results

## Find work items

**By work item ID**  
Type the project identifier and number to jump directly to that work item.

**By title or keywords**  
Search finds work items with matching text in their titles or descriptions.

## Find other content

**Projects**  
Search by project name or identifier.

**Cycles and modules**  
Search by cycle or module name.

**Pages**  
Search page titles and content.

**Work item comments**  
Search finds comments containing your keywords.

## What you can search

Search looks through:
- Work item titles and descriptions
- Project names and identifiers
- Cycle and module names
- Page titles and content
- Saved view names
- Comment text
- Teamspace names

**Search features:**
- **Real-time results** - Updates as you type
- **Partial matching** - "dev" finds "development"
- **Case insensitive** - Capitalization doesn't matter

## What you won't see

Search only shows content you have permission to access:
- Private projects you're not a member of won't appear
- Archived and deleted items are hidden
- Work items from projects you can't access are filtered out

This keeps your search results relevant and maintains project security.
