description: Manage user roles and permissions in workspaces.
---


Each user in your workspace has a role, which defines their level of access and permissions. Here’s a quick overview of the available roles:

- **Admin**  
  Admins have full access to everything in the workspace. They can manage members, update settings, and perform all actions across projects, cycles, and modules. If you're an admin, you’re essentially running the show.

- **Member**  
  Members are your core team. They can create, edit, and delete content in projects, cycles, and modules. Members also can create new projects. This role works well for collaborators who need to contribute to day-to-day tasks.

- **Guest**  
  Guests are external collaborators—like clients or contractors—who need limited access. They can only view the specific content they've been invited to and cannot be assigned to work items. This role is perfect for keeping outsiders in the loop without giving them full access.

### Grant view access to Guests

You can turn on this setting in **Project Settings > Members**. Enabling this setting allows guest users to view all project work items, providing them with broader visibility into the project's progress and details. This is useful for external stakeholders who need full context without editing permissions.
