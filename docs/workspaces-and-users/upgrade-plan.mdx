## Self-hosted only

:::warning
Starting v1.3.0 of our Commercial Edition, your license will need to be activated on a workspace. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.
:::

:::tip
Steps #1 through #5 from above work the exact same way on self-hosted, too.
:::

1.  If your payment goes through, you will be redirected to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses), your one-stop interface to manage your licenses and buy new ones.
    :::warning
    You can always directly log into the Prime Portal, especially if you pre-ordered one of our plans, with the same email address you used to purchase one of our paid plans. You will get a code at the same address that will sign you in.
    :::
2.  Find the license by the plan you just subscribed to. Copy the **License key** for the license you want to activate.

    :::note
    Click the Get more licenses button as in the image above on the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses/plans) to buy more licenses.
    :::
3.  Go back to the **Billing and plans** screen, usually already open in your browser.
4.  Click the **Activate this Workspace** button.
    ![Activate workspace](https://media.docs.plane.so/activate-license/enter-license-key-selfhosted.webp#center)
5.  Paste the license key in the **Enter license key** box.
6.  Click **Activate**. You will see a confirmation.
7.  That's it. To check your plan at any time and find additional details, just go to the **Billing and plans** tab in **Workspace Settings**.
