## Delink license key

Your license key is linked to both a workspace and an instance, meaning it can only be used on one workspace on one machine at a time. If you switch machines or reinstall the Commercial edition, you’ll need to reactivate your workspace. This helps prevent any misuse of the license on multiple machines or workspaces.

To make it easier for you to move between machines or workspaces, we've added a new Delink feature. This lets you free up your license from its current workspace, so you can reuse it on a new machine or workspace.

Here’s how to delink your license key from a workspace:

1. Head over to the **Billing and Plans** screen of the workspace that's currently using the license.
2. Click **Delink license key**. This will release the license key, making it available for use on another machine or workspace.

3. Restart the instance using `prime-cli restart`.
4. If you’re switching machines or reinstalling the Commercial edition, see [Move Plane instance to another server](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/manage/migrate-plane).
5. Ensure you are connected to the internet and reactivate the new workspace using the license key you delinked earlier.
