Dashboards in Plane give you a bird's-eye view of your projects through customizable visualizations. They help you monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions without diving into individual projects.

### Widget types

![Dashboards](https://media.docs.plane.so/dashboards/dashboards.webp#center)

#### Bar chart
Perfect for comparing quantities across categories, like work items by priority or state. The bars make it easy to spot patterns and imbalances.

#### Line chart
Ideal for tracking trends over time, such as completed work items per week. Use these to identify patterns and forecast future performance.

#### Area chart
Similar to line charts but with the area below the line filled in, making it easier to visualize volume changes over time.

#### Donut chart
Great for showing proportions and percentages of a whole, like work item types or assignee workload distribution.

#### Pie chart
Another option for displaying proportional data when you need to see how different segments relate to the whole.

#### Number
Simple counters that show important metrics like total work items, overdue tasks, or completed items. Use these for at-a-glance KPIs.
