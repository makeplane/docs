## Push notifications

::: info
Push notifications are currently available only for Plane Cloud users.
:::

The Plane mobile app supports push notifications to keep you updated on important activities. To start receiving notifications, make sure to turn them on in the app settings. Once turned on, you'll be notified about relevant updates, ensuring you never miss an important change or task.

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to log in to the mobile app

<div style="color: red">Error: 404 Page Not Found</div>

This error occurs when attempting to log in to the mobile app with a self-hosted URL on the Community Edition or an outdated version of the Commercial Edition.

- Ensure your Plane instance is running the Commercial Edition version `v1.5.0` or higher. If you are using an older version, [update to the latest version](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/manage/upgrade-plane#prerequisites).

- If you are on the Community Edition, [upgrade to the Commercial Edition](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/upgrade-from-community) to access mobile app functionality.

- Retry logging in and ensure the self-hosted URL is entered correctly in the app.

### Sign-in issues on Android

If you're having trouble signing into the Plane app on your Android device, here are a few steps you can follow to get things working:

**Sign-in button doesn’t open the app?**  
Make sure you have a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) installed on your phone.

**App still not opening, even with a browser installed?**

1. Check which profile the Plane app is installed under — Personal or Work.
2. Make sure the browser is also installed in the same profile.

**Browser opens, but sign-in keeps looping?**  
This might be due to default browser settings. Try the following:

    1. Open your device’s **Settings**.
    2. Go to **Apps** or **Default Apps**.
    3. Find and tap on the browser you're using.
    4. Look for an option like **Clear defaults** or **Reset default app**
    5. Clear the defaults, then try signing in again.

    You’ll be prompted to choose a browser. Choose one that's in the same profile as the Plane app.

**Still stuck?**  
Try clearing site data: 1. When the web sign-in page opens, tap the three-dot menu (usually in the top-right corner of the browser). 2. Go to **Settings → Site settings → Clear data** (wording may vary slightly by browser). 3. Try the sign-in process again.

### Unable to log in using SSO

Ensure the correct Redirect URI is configured in your OAuth service:

- For Google Sign-In: Add the following URL to the Redirect URIs section in your Google Cloud Console:
  ```bash
  https://<plane.example.com>/auth/mobile/google/callback/
  ```
- For GitHub Sign-In: Add the following URL to the Callback URL section in your GitHub OAuth app:
  `bash
  https://<plane.example.com>/auth/mobile/github/callback/
  `
  Verify that the `<plane.example.com>` part of the URL matches your self-hosted instance's domain.

### Link not opening iOS app

If clicking links doesn't open the Plane iOS app and instead redirects to your browser, this is usually related to how iOS handles Universal Links.

**Why this happens**

1. Your default browser may not be Safari.
2. You may have previously opened the web app (`https://app.plane.so`) in your browser, causing iOS to associate the domain with the browser instead of the app.

**How to fix it**

1. Open the link in Safari.
2. A banner will appear at the top that says **Open** and stays for about a second.
3. Tap **Open** before the banner disappears to launch the Plane app.
4. Try clicking the link from any other app to verify that it now opens the Plane app directly.
