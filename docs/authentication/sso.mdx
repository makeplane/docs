Single sign-on (SSO) lets your team sign in to Plane using your organization's identity provider instead of managing separate passwords. This centralizes authentication, improves security, and simplifies user management.

## Verify your domain

Before configuring SSO, you must verify ownership of your organization's email domain. This ensures only authorized administrators can configure authentication for that domain.

:::caution
Each domain can only be verified in one workspace at a time. If you've already verified a domain in another workspace, you'll need to remove it there first.
:::

### Add your domain

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings → Identity**.
2. Under **Domain management**, click **Add domain**.

   ![Add domain](https://media.docs.plane.so/sso/add-domain.webp#hero-tl)

3. Enter your domain (for example, `acme.com`) and click Add domain.
4. In the **Verify your domain** modal that appears, copy the **TXT record value**.

   ![Verify domain](https://media.docs.plane.so/sso/verify-domain.webp#hero)
   :::tip
   Click **I'll do it later** if you need time to access your DNS. Your domain will appear with a *Pending* status. To resume verification later, click the **⋯** menu next to your domain and select **Verify**.
   :::

### Add the DNS record
1. Sign in to your DNS provider.
2. Create a new TXT record:
   - **Host/Name**: `@` (or leave blank for root domain).
   - **Value**: Paste the TXT record value from Plane.
   - **TTL**: Use default or 3600.
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation.
4. Return to Plane and click **Verify domain**. 

Once verified, the status changes to *Verified* and you can configure SSO.

:::tip
DNS propagation times vary by provider. If verification fails immediately, wait a few more minutes and try again. You can check if the TXT record is live using `dig TXT yourdomain.com` or online DNS lookup tools.

## Configure SSO

Plane supports two authentication protocols. Choose the one that matches your identity provider.

### OIDC (OpenID Connect)

OIDC works best with modern cloud identity providers like Google Workspace, Auth0, Okta, and Keycloak.

#### Get Plane connection details

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings → Identity**.
2. Click **Configure** next to **Enable OIDC**.
3. Click **Get setup details** and copy these values:
   - **Origin URL**
   - **Redirect URL**
   - **Logout URL**

   You'll use these when configuring your IdP.

#### Register Plane in your identity provider

The exact steps vary by provider, but generally:

1. Sign in to your identity provider.
2. Create a new **Web Application** or **OIDC Client**.
3. Paste the **Redirect URL** from Plane into the redirect URI field.
4. Configure the application:
   - Application type: **Web Application**.
   - Enable authorization code flow.
   - Request scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`.
5. Save and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** your IdP generates.

#### Configure OIDC in Plane

   ![Configure OIDC](https://media.docs.plane.so/sso/configure-oidc.webp#hero)

1. Return to Plane and enter the following details from your identity provider:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Client ID** | The application ID from your IdP |
   | **Client secret** | The secret key for authentication |
   | **Authorize URL** | The endpoint where users see the login screen |
   | **Token URL** | The endpoint Plane uses to exchange authorization codes for tokens |
   | **Users' info URL** | The endpoint that returns user profile information |
   | **Logout URL** | *(Optional)* Where users go after signing out |

2. Click **Save changes** to activate OIDC authentication.

### SAML 2.0

SAML works well with traditional enterprise identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and on-premise Active Directory.

#### Get Plane connection details

1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings → Identity**.
2. Click **Configure** next to **Enable SAML**.
3. Click **Get setup details** and copy these values:
   - **Entity ID / Audience / Metadata information**
   - **SSO URL**
   - **SLO URL**

#### Create a SAML application in your IdP

1. Sign in to your identity provider.
2. Create a new **SAML 2.0 Application**.
3. Configure the service provider settings:
   - **Entity ID / Audience**: Paste the Entity ID from Plane.
   - **ACS URL / SSO URL**: Paste the SSO URL from Plane.
   - **SLO URL**: Paste the SLO URL from Plane.
4. Configure attribute mapping to send the `email` attribute in the SAML assertion. Optionally map `firstName` and `lastName`.
5. Save and copy your IdP's SAML configuration:
   - **SSO URL** (sign-in endpoint)
   - **Entity ID**
   - **X.509 Certificate**

#### Configure SAML in Plane

   ![Configure SAML](https://media.docs.plane.so/sso/configure-saml.webp#hero)

1. Return to Plane and enter the following details from your identity provider:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Entity ID** | Your IdP's unique identifier |
   | **SSO URL** | The endpoint where Plane redirects users for authentication |
   | **Logout URL** | *(Optional)* Where users go after signing out |
   | **Certificate** | The X.509 certificate from your IdP |

2. Click **Configure and enable** to activate SAML authentication.

## How SSO works in Plane

Once SSO is enabled:

   - When users visit your Plane workspace, they see the **Sign in with Single Sign-On** button.

      ![Sign in with SSO](https://media.docs.plane.so/sso/sign-in-with-sso.webp#hero)

   - Clicking it redirects them to your identity provider.
   - After authentication, they're signed in to Plane automatically.
   - Their Plane account is created automatically on first sign-in if it doesn't exist.
