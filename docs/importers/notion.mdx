The Notion to Plane importer lets you transfer your Notion pages and content to Plane's Wiki. This is useful when you want to bring your documentation, notes, and structured content from Notion into your Plane workspace as Wiki pages.

The importer takes exported Notion content and converts it into Plane wiki pages. It preserves your page structure, including subpages, and maintains the hierarchical organization of your Notion workspace within Plane's wiki system.

## Export your Notion content

1. Open the Notion page you want to export.
2. Click the three-dot menu (â‹¯) in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Select **Export** from the dropdown menu.
4. In the export dialog:
  - **Export format**: Choose **HTML**
  - **Include databases**: Select **Current view**
  - **Include content**: Choose **Everything**
  - **Include subpages**: Toggle this **ON**
  - **Create folders for subpages**: Toggle this **ON**
  - **Export comments**: Toggle this **OFF** (unless you want comments included)

  :::info
  Only HTML exports from Notion are supported. Make sure to select HTML as your export format.

5. Click **Export**.
