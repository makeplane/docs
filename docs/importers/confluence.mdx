The Confluence to Plane importer lets you transfer your Confluence pages and content to Plane's Wiki. This is useful when you want to bring your documentation, notes, and structured content from Confluence into your Plane workspace as Wiki pages.

The importer takes exported Confluence content and converts it into Plane Wiki pages. It preserves your page structure, including subpages, and maintains the hierarchical organization of your Confluence space within Plane's Wiki system.

## Export your Confluence content

First, you need to export your content from Confluence:

1. Navigate to your Confluence space.
2. Go to **Space settings** (you can find this in the space sidebar or settings menu).
3. In the left sidebar, expand **General** if it's not already expanded.
4. Click on **Export space**.
5. In the export options:
  - **File format**: Select **HTML**.
6. After selecting HTML, you'll see additional options:
  - Choose **Export each item, with attachments. Comments are excluded.**
    :::info
    Only HTML exports from Confluence are supported. Make sure to select HTML as your export format.
    :::
7. Click **Export**.
8. The system will process your export and show a progress bar with time elapsed, time remaining, and completion percentage.
9. Once complete, you'll see "Export complete. Download here.". Click the download link.
10. Confluence will generate a ZIP file containing your exported content.
