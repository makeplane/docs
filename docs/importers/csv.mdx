# Import your CSV data to Plane

With the CSV importer, you can easily import work items from your CSV file to Plane.

:::info
The CSV importert is available on Plane Cloud and on all plans of the Commercial Edition for self-hosted instances.

## Import from CSV
> **Role**: Workspace admins

:::caution[Work Item Types]
To import work item types, make sure the [Work item types](/core-concepts/issues/issue-types) feature is enabled in your Plane project.
:::

Here's how to get started:

1. Click your Workspace name at the top left on the sidebar.

2. Select **Settings**.

3. In the right pane, click on **Imports**.

4. You'll see several import options - look for the **CSV Importers** tile and click the **Import** button.

5. Use the dropdown to select the project where you want your CSV data to go. If you haven't created your destination project yet, you'll need to create it first.

6. Click the **Upload CSV** button.

    :::warning[Prepare your CSV]
    When importing user fields like **Assignee**, make sure to use email addresses rather than usernames. This ensures your team members are correctly linked to their work items.
    :::

7. You can either drag and drop your file onto the upload area or click **Upload file** to browse your files. Alternatively, you can click **Manually enter data** if you prefer to input information directly.

8. You'll need to match your CSV columns to Plane fields:
    - You'll see your CSV fields listed under **INCOMING FIELDS** on the left.
    - On the right, under **DESTINATION FIELDS**, select the corresponding Plane field for each item. Fields will be automatically mapped when names match, but you can adjust as needed.
    - Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

9. Once you've mapped your fields, click **Continue** to proceed.

10. You'll see a preview of your data in a table view:
    - Review the data to make sure everything looks correct.
    - If something's not right, you can click Back to adjust your field mapping.
    - When you're ready, click **Submit** to import your data.

11. That's it! Your CSV data is now imported into your Plane project. For very large datasets, the import might take a few minutes to process.

12. Once it's done, go to **Work Items** in your Plane project to confirm that the data import is successful.
