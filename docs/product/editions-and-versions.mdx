# Understanding Plane editions and versions

Plane is available in three distinct editions: Cloud, Commercial Edition, and Community Edition. Each caters to different user needs, whether you're relying on our hosted services or self-hosting Plane on your infrastructure. Here's everything you need to know about these editions, how versions differ across them, and how you can check and update your version.

## About our editions

### Cloud

The Cloud edition is fully managed by us, ensuring you always have the latest features, updates, and bug fixes without lifting a finger. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any point. 

### Self-hosted Commercial Edition

This is designed for businesses that require advanced features and want to self-host Plane on their infrastructure.

The Commercial Edition (closed source) includes a free plan with all the features available in Cloud and makes it easier to upgrade to a paid plan at any time.

### Self-hosted Community Edition

This is our open-source self-hosted solution for developers who want to customize and modify the code as needed.

## Version differences

Each edition of Plane is built on a distinct codebase. This means the versions across the Cloud, Commercial, and Community Editions may differ. Despite this, our Cloud and Commercial Editions maintain full feature parity, ensuring a consistent experience whether you opt for our hosted service or self-hosted enterprise solution.
