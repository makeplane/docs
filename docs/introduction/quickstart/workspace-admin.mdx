# Set up Plane for your team

## Set up your Workspace 

When you signed up for Plane, you would have already created a new workspace. Let's make your workspace feel like home for your team.

### Update your workspace details

1. Navigate to Workspace Settings.
2. Upload your company logo.
3. Update workspace name if you need to change it. 

:::warning
The Workspace URL cannot be changed after creation. So be careful when provide this slug at the time of creation. 
:::

### Invite your team
Get your team members into the workspace so they can start collaborating.

1. Under Workspace Settings where you already are, click Members tab on the left pane.
2. Click the **Add member** button in the top-right.
3. In the **Invite people to collaborate** dialog:
    - Type the email address in the provided box.
    - Select the role you want them to have. 
       - Admin: Full workspace control and settings access.
       - Member (Default): Can create projects, issues, and collaborate fully.
       - Guest: Limited access to specific projects they're invited to.
    :::tip
    üí° You can always change roles later in Members settings.
    :::
    - Use the **+ Add more** link to invite multiple people at once.
4. Click "Send invitation"

Team members receive email invitations and can access the workspace.

## Create your first project
Let's create a project where your team can start working immediately.

1. Look for **Projects** section on your sidebar.
2. Click the **+** button next to it. 
3. Select **Create project**. This opens the project creation form where you'll define your project's basic information.
4. In the project creation form:
    1. enter the name  and write a brief description explaining what this project aims to accomplish.
    2. Select the State that the project is in Draft, Planning, Execution. etc.
    3. By default, the project access is **Public** This means that all Workspace Admins and Members can see and join this project. Change this to Private if you want members to join only through invite.
    4. Select start and end dates if you want to and assign priority. 
    5. Assign a project lead and add the members you want to part of this project. 
5. Click **Create project** to finish the basic setup.

Congratulations! You now have a project. 

You can always modify these settings at any later point in time in your Project Settings.
