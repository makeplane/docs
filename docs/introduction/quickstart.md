Your workspace is the central hub where all your projects and team collaboration will happen, so let’s make it feel like home.

### Customize workspace details

     - Guest: Limited access to specific projects they're invited to.
   - Use the **+ Add more** link to invite multiple people at once.
4. Click **Send invitation**.

Team members will receive email invitations and can access the workspace.

## Create your project

Now that your workspace is ready, it’s time to create your first project. Projects keep all related tasks and work items organized in one place, making it easy to focus on specific goals. Let's set up a project and add work items with basic properties to get your team started on their tasks.

![Create project](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-project.webp#hero)

1. Look for **Projects** tab under the **Workspace** section on your sidebar.
2. Click the **Add Project** button.
3. In the project creation form:
   1. Enter the name and write a brief description explaining what this project aims to accomplish.
   2. Select `Planning` in the **State** dropdown.
   3. By default, the project access is **Public** This means that all Workspace Admins and Members can see and join this project. Change this to **Private** if you want members to join only through invite.
   4. Select start and end dates if you want to and set a priority level.
   5. Assign a project Lead and add the Members you want to part of this project.
4. Click **Create project** to finish the basic setup.
5. You’ll see a modal with all the features enabled for this project. Leave the defaults as they are and click **Open project**.

Your team can see the project and access it from their workspace.

## Create your work items

Add tasks so your team can start working immediately.

![Create work item](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-work-item.webp#hero)

1. Navigate to the **Work items** page under your new project.
2. Click **Add work item**.
3. Enter title and brief description about the work item.  
   _Example:_
   - **Title**  
     _Design new homepage layout_
   - **Description**  
     _Create a fresh layout for the homepage focusing on improved navigation, modern visuals, and clear call-to-actions._
4. Set work item properties:
   - **Assignee**: `You`
   - **Priority**: `Medium`
   - **Start date**: Today
   - **Due date**: One week from today
5. Click **Save** to create the work item.
6. You'll see a new row added in the List layout.
7. Add a few more work items in the same manner.

Team members see their assigned work and can start immediately.

## Plan your first Cycle

In this final step, you’ll learn how to organize your work into cycles (time-bound periods) for managing tasks like sprints. Cycles help you track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay on top of deadlines.

![Create cycles](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-cycles.webp#hero)

1. Click **Cycles** in your project sidebar.
2. Click the **Add cycle** button on the top right.
3. In the Create cycle modal:
   - Name your cycle: `Sprint 1`.
   - Set date range: 2 weeks (today through next Friday)
   - Click **Create cycle**.
4. Click on your newly created cycle name to open it.
5. Click **Add existing work item**
6. Select the issues you created earlier.
7. Click **Add to cycle**.
8. Return to the main Cycles page to view your active cycle with progress indicators.

Your active cycle shows work items with progress tracking and burndown visualization.

::: tip
Cycles work best when they're 1-2 weeks long and contain achievable goals for your team.
