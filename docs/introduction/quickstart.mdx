Your workspace is the central hub where all your projects and team collaboration will happen, so letâ€™s make it feel like home.

    - Use the **+ Add more** link to invite multiple people at once.
4. Click **Send invitation**.

Team members will receive email invitations and can access the workspace.

## Create your project

Now that your workspace is ready, itâ€™s time to create your first project. Projects keep all related tasks and work items organized in one place, making it easy to focus on specific goals. Let's set up a project and add work items with basic properties to get your team started on their tasks.

![Create project](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-project.webp#center)

1. Look for **Projects** tab under the **Workspace** section on your sidebar.
2. Click the **Add Project** button.
4. In the project creation form:
    1. Enter the name  and write a brief description explaining what this project aims to accomplish.
    2. Select `Planning` in the **State** dropdown.
    3. By default, the project access is **Public** This means that all Workspace Admins and Members can see and join this project. Change this to **Private** if you want members to join only through invite.
    4. Select start and end dates if you want to and set a priority level. 
    5. Assign a project Lead and add the Members you want to part of this project. 
5. Click **Create project** to finish the basic setup.
6. Youâ€™ll see a modal with all the features enabled for this project. Leave the defaults as they are and click **Open project**.

Your team can see the project and access it from their workspace.

## Create your work items

Add tasks so your team can start working immediately.
![Create work item](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-work-item.webp#center)

1. Navigate to the **Work items** page under your new project.
2. Click **Add work item**.
3. Enter title and brief description about the work item.  
   *Example:* 
   - **Title**  
    *Design new homepage layout*
   - **Description**  
   *Create a fresh layout for the homepage focusing on improved navigation, modern visuals, and clear call-to-actions.*
3. Set work item properties:   
   - **Assignee**:  `You`
   - **Priority**: `Medium`
   - **Start date**: Today
   - **Due date**: One week from today
6. Click **Save** to create the work item. 
7. You'll see a new row added in the List layout. 
8. Add a few more work items in the same manner.

Team members see their assigned work and can start immediately.

## Plan your first Cycle

In this final step, youâ€™ll learn how to organize your work into cycles (time-bound periods) for managing tasks like sprints. Cycles help you track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay on top of deadlines.

![Create cycles](https://media.docs.plane.so/quickstart/create-cycles.webp#center)

1. Click **Cycles** in your project sidebar.
2. Click the **Add cycle** button on the top right.
3. In the Create cycle modal:
    - Name your cycle: `Sprint 1`.
    - Set date range: 2 weeks (today through next Friday)
    - Click **Create cycle**.
4. Click on your newly created cycle name to open it.
5. Click **Add existing work item**
6. Select the issues you created earlier. 
7. Click **Add to cycle**. 
8. Return to the main Cycles page to view your active cycle with progress indicators.

Your active cycle shows work items with progress tracking and burndown visualization.

:::tip
Cycles work best when they're 1-2 weeks long and contain achievable goals for your team.
