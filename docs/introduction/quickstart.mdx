# Quickstart guide

This interactive walkthrough will help you get up and running with Plane in no time. You’ll learn how to set up your workspace, create projects, add and manage work items, organize work into cycles, and track progress—all through easy-to-follow steps.

## Set up your Workspace

When you sign up for the first time on Plane, we'll prompt you to create a new Workspace. In this guide, you'll see how to customize the Workspace and invite your team members. Your workspace is the central hub where all your projects and team collaboration will happen, so let’s make it feel like home.

## Create Projects and Work items

Now that your workspace is ready, it’s time to create your first project. Projects keep all related tasks and work items organized in one place, making it easy to focus on specific goals. In this step, you’ll set up a project and add work items with basic properties to get your team started on their tasks.

## Create and track Cycles

In this final step, you’ll learn how to organize your work into cycles—time-bound periods for managing tasks like sprints. Cycles help you track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay on top of deadlines. Here, you’ll create cycles, add work items, and learn how to track your team’s work over time.
