# Collaborate on work items
Now that you can create and manage work items, let's learn how to collaborate with your team.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- Added comments to communicate with your team
- Used @mentions to notify specific people
- Created sub-work items to break down complex tasks
- Understood how activity tracking and notifications work

## Add your first comment

1.Navigate to your project and go to **Work items**.
2. Click on any work item to open it in peek view.
3. Click the expand icon to open it in full view for better collaboration space. Full view gives you more room to work with comments, sub-items, and detailed discussions.

4. Scroll down to the Activity section. This shows:
    - All updates and changes to the work item
    - Comments from team members
    - A timeline of what happened when

5. Click in the "Add comment" text area. Write a meaningful comment about the work.

Example:
"Started working on this - I've identified the CSS issue and should have a fix ready by tomorrow."

The comment box also includes formatting options.

6. Click **Comment** to post it. Your comment appears in the activity timeline and all relevant team members get notified.

## Use @mentions 
Mentions ensure the right people see important messages:

- Type @ followed by a team member's name.
- Select the person from the dropdown that appears.
-  your message

Example with mention:
"@sarah the design looks great! One question about the color scheme - should we use the brand blue or the darker variant for the call-to-action buttons?"


Step 4: Create sub-work items
For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable pieces:
When to use sub-work items

Large features that need multiple steps
Tasks requiring different skills or team members
Work that can be done in parallel
Projects with clear phases or milestones

Create a sub-work item

In your work item, look for "Add sub-work item" button
Click it to create a related, smaller task
Fill in the sub-item details:

Clear, specific title
Brief description
Assign to appropriate team member
Set realistic due date



Example parent task: "Implement user authentication system"
Sub-work items might be:

"Design login page wireframes"
"Set up authentication database tables"
"Create password reset flow"
"Write user registration API endpoints"

Manage sub-work items

Each sub-item has its own lifecycle and can be worked on independently
Parent task progress automatically updates based on sub-item completion
Team members can focus on their specific sub-items while staying connected to the bigger picture


Step 5: Update assignees and collaborate on changes
Sometimes work needs to move between team members:
Add or remove assignees

Click the "Assignees" field in the work item
Add someone by selecting from the dropdown
Remove someone by clicking the X next to their name

Common collaboration patterns

Handoff work - Remove yourself, add the next person
Pair work - Keep multiple people assigned for collaboration
Review process - Add reviewer when work is ready for feedback

Communicate assignment changes
When changing assignees, always add a comment explaining:
"@john passing this to you for the backend implementation. I've completed the frontend components and they're ready for integration."

Step 6: Track activity and filter updates
Stay informed about what's happening across your work items:
Understanding the Activity section
The activity feed shows chronological updates:

Work item changes - State updates, priority changes, assignment changes
Comments - Team discussions and communications
System updates - Automated notifications about related work

Filter activity types
Click the "Filters" button in the Activity section to control what you see:

Updates - Show only property changes (state, priority, etc.)
Comments - Show only team discussions
Worklogs - Show only time tracking entries

This helps you focus on the type of information most relevant to you.
Activity timeline benefits

Catch up quickly - See what happened while you were away
Understand decisions - Read the discussion that led to changes
Track progress - Monitor how work moves through your workflow


Step 7: Understanding notifications
Plane automatically keeps relevant people informed:
Who gets notified
You'll receive notifications when:

Someone @mentions you in a comment
Work items assigned to you are updated
Work items you created have activity
Someone comments on work items you're following

Notification channels

In-app notifications - Badge counters and notification panel
Email notifications - Digest emails about important updates
Real-time updates - Live updates when viewing work items

Managing notification overload

Subscribe/Unsubscribe - Use the subscription button to control which work items notify you
Mention thoughtfully - Only @mention people who truly need to respond
Update efficiently - Batch related changes to reduce notification noise
