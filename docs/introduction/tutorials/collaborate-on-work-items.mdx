![Add comments](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/add-comments.webp#center)

1. **Open a work item for collaboration**
   - Navigate to your project and go to **Work items**,
   - Click any work item to open it.

2. **Add a meaningful comment**
   - Scroll to the **Activity** section.
   - Click in the **Add comment** text area.
   - Write a comment that provides value to the team.

    *Example:*
    ```
    Started working on this - I've identified the CSS issue and should have a fix ready by tomorrow. The problem is with the media query breakpoint at 375px.
    ```

3. **Use formatting options**
   - Bold important information with **text**.
   - Create lists for multiple points.
   - Add code snippets or quotes. 

4. **Post your comment**
   - Click **Comment** to publish.
   - Your comment appears in the activity timeline.
   - Relevant team members receive notifications.

## Use @mentions
Ensure the right people see important messages and requests.
1. Type @ followed by a team member's name.
2. Select the person from the dropdown that appears.
3. Continue writing your message with context.  
    
## Divide work with sub-work items

Organize large tasks into manageable, assignable pieces.

![Sub-work items](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/create-sub-work-items.webp#center)

1. **Use sub-work items for:**
- Large tasks requiring multiple steps
- Tasks needing different skills or team members
- Work that can be done in parallel

2. **Add a sub-work item**
   - In your work item, look for **Add sub-work item** button.
   - Click to create a related, smaller task.
   - Fill in the sub-item details with specificity.

    *Example:*
    - **Parent task:** "Implement user authentication system"
    - **Sub-work items:**
        - "Design login page wireframes" → Designer
        - "Set up authentication database tables" → Backend developer  
        - "Create password reset flow" → Frontend developer
        - "Write user registration API endpoints" → Backend developer

3. **Understand sub-item benefits**
   - Each sub-item has independent lifecycle and can be worked on separately.
   - Team members focus on specific sub-items while staying connected to bigger picture.
   - Clear ownership and accountability for different aspects of complex work.


## Track activity and filter updates

Stay informed about work progress without information overload.

1. **Understand the Activity section**
   The activity feed shows chronological updates:
   - **Work item changes:** State updates, priority changes, assignment changes.
   - **Comments:** Team discussions and communications.

2. **Use activity filters**
   - Click **Filters** button in the Activity section.
   - Control what information you see:
        - **Updates:** Show only property changes (state, priority, assignments)
        - **Comments:** Display only team discussions and communications
        - **Worklogs:** View only time tracking entries

3. **Use activity tracking strategically**
   - **Catch up quickly:** See what happened while you were away.
   - **Understand decisions:** Read discussions that led to changes.
   - **Track progress:** Monitor how work moves through workflow.
   - **Maintain context:** Keep team members informed of important developments.
