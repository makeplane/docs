# Create and manage work items
Now that your project is set up, let's add your first piece of work to track. Work items are the fundamental building blocks in Plane - they represent any task or piece of work your team needs to complete.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- Created your first work item
- Set essential properties like priority, assignee, and dates
- Updated a work item through your workflow states
- Completed your first work item lifecycle


## Create your first work item
Let's add a real piece of work to your project:

1. Navigate to your project by clicking its name in the sidebar.Make sure you're in the **Work items** tab.

2. Click **Add work item** in the top-right corner. This opens the work item creation dialog where you'll define what needs to be done.

3. Add a clear title and a detailed description.
    :::tip[Example]

    **Title**  
    "Fix login button alignment on mobile"

    **Description**  
    The login button on mobile devices is misaligned and appears cut off on screens smaller than 375px width. 

    Steps to reproduce:  
        a) Visit login page on mobile device.   
        b) Notice button extends beyond screen edge.

    Expected result:   
        Button should be fully visible and properly centered.

4. Now configure the properties that help organize and prioritize your work:
    - **Choose the state**  
    The **State** shows where this work item is in your workflow: For your first work item, select `Planned` since you're ready to work on it.

    - **Set priority level**  
    Click the **Priority** dropdown to indicate how urgent this work is. For this tutorial, choose `Medium` priority.

    - **Assign to someone**  
    Click **Assignees** to assign this work. Assign this first work item to yourself.

    - **Add relevant labels**  
    Click **Labels** and select any that apply to categorize your work. Choose the `frontend` label for this work item.

    - **Set start and due dates**  
        **Start date** - When you plan to begin this work  
        **Due date** - When this work should be completed

        For this tutorial, you can skip dates or set a due date a few days from now.

5. Once you've filled in the essential details, click **Save** to create it.

Congratulations! You'll see your work item appear in the project list with a unique ID (like "ENG-1" or "PROJ-1" depending on your project identifier).

## Update your work item
Now let's explore how to access and view work items:

1. In the current **List** layout, you'll see your newly created item with a few details.

2. Click anywhere on your work item row to open it in peek view - a side panel that shows details without leaving the main page.

3. For more detailed work, click the expand icon (diagonal arrows) in the peek view, or right-click the work item and select **Open in new tab**.

3. Let's practice moving work through your workflow:

    1. Click on the **State** field.
    2. Change it from `Planned` to `In Progress`.
    3. The change saves automatically. Notice how the work item moves to a different section in your layout view, reflecting its new state.

    4. Update other properties. Practice changing other fields:
        - Change priority if you discover it's more or less urgent
        - Adjust due date based on your progress
        - Add or remove labels as you learn more about the work

    All changes save automatically, and you'll see them reflected immediately in your project view.

## Move work to completion

1. Switch to Board view.
2. Look for the layout options on the top right of the screen.
3. Click the Board icon. You'll now see your work items organized in columns by state.
4. Find your work item in the current state column (likely "In Progress").
5. Drag and drop the work item card to the "Done" or "Completed" column.

The work item automatically updates its state when you drop it, and you'll see it move visually from one column to another.


If you prefer, you can still update the state directly by opening your work item and clicking the "State" field to select "Done"..

Both methods accomplish the same result - the drag and drop approach gives you a visual, intuitive way to move work through your workflow states.
