# Create workspace
Let's get you set up your workspace where you and your team can collaborate on projects.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- Created new workspace<br/>
- Understood how to switch between workspaces<br/>
- Learned where to manage workspace settings<br/>

## Create new workspace
If you've already signed up for Plane, you already have your first workspace that was created during [signup](https://app.plane.so/sign-up). This tutorial shows you how to create additional workspaces.

:::info
ðŸ’¡ Don't need another workspace right now? You can skip to [step 2](/getting-started/tutorials/create-workspace#explore-your-new-workspace) to learn about workspace navigation with your existing workspace.
:::

To create a new workspace:

1. Click on your current workspace name in the top-left corner.
2. In the workspace switcher, click **Create workspace** at the bottom.
3. You'll see the workspace creation form. Let's fill it out:

    - **Name your workspace**  
    In the **Name your workspace** field, enter something familiar and recognizable for your team, usually the company name.

        :::tip
        Choose something your team will instantly recognize. You can always change this later in settings.
        :::

    - **Set your workspace URL**  
    Your workspace URL will be automatically generated from your workspace name, but you can customize it:

        Format: `app.plane.so/your-custom-slug`

        :::warning
        This choice is permanent and cannot be changed later. Make sure itâ€™s exactly how you want it before continuing. 
        :::

    - **Select team size**  
    Choose the range that best matches your expected team size. This helps Plane optimize your experience. Don't worry about being exact. You can always invite more people later

4. Click **Create workspace** to finish setup.

Congratulations! You now have a workspace. Here's what you can see:

- Your workspace name appears in the top-left with a colored avatar.
- You're automatically set as the Admin with full permissions.
- The workspace shows 1 Member (you!)

## Learn workspace navigation
### Switch between workspaces
Click on your workspace name (top-left) to see the workspace switcher:
