1. In your sidebar, click **Pages** under your project name.

2. Notice the three tabs: **Public**, **Private**, and **Archived**. By default, all pages you create are Public - meaning other project members can view and edit them.

3. Click **Add page** in the top-right corner. A new untitled page opens in the editor

4. Click the icon placeholder next to "Untitled" to choose an icon.

5. Click on "Untitled" and replace with `Project Requirements Document`. The page automatically saves your changes.
