# Plan work with Cycles

Cycles help you organize work into focused time periods - like sprints. Instead of endless lists of work items, cycles create clear boundaries with start dates, end dates, and specific goals your team can work toward together.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- Created your first cycle with clear timeframe and goals
- Added work items to organize what gets done when
- Understood how to track progress and team velocity
- Learned to manage work within time boundaries

## Understand what cycles do
Cycles are time-boxed containers for your work. Think of them like focused work periods where your team commits to completing specific work items within a set timeframe.

### When to use cycles
Sprint planning - 1-2 week focused work periods
Release cycles - Group work leading to a product release

### Benefits of working in cycles
- Clear deadlines create urgency and focus
- Team alignment on what's being worked on when
- Progress tracking shows velocity and capacity over time
- Regular delivery of completed work to stakeholders

## Create your first cycle

1. In your project sidebar, click **Cycles**. 
    The Cycles page shows you all cycles organized by status: active, upcoming, completed, and drafts. This gives you a timeline view of your project's planned work.

2. Click the **Add cycle** button in the top-right. The cycle creation dialog opens
    - Choose a clear title
    - Pick a name that describes the cycle's purpose and timeframe:
        Example
        "Sprint 1: User Authentication"
    - Add a helpful description Explain what this cycle aims to accomplish:
        Example:
        "Complete core user authentication features including login, registration, password reset, and basic profile management. Goal is to have a functional auth system ready for beta testing."
    - Set your timeframe
        Start date - When work begins (often Monday)
        End date - When work should be complete (typically 1-2 weeks later)
 
    For your first cycle, try a 2-week period starting next Monday. This gives you enough time to complete meaningful work without losing focus.

3. Click **Create cycle** to save it. Your cycle now appears in the "Upcoming" or "Active" section. depending on your start date.

## Add work items to your cycle
Now populate your cycle with the work to be completed:

1. Click on your newly created cycle name
2. You'll see the cycle detail view showing progress charts and work item areas
3. You have two options for adding work:
    - Create new work items
    - Add existing work items
4. For your first cycle, start small:
    - New team: 3-5 work items
    - Experienced team: 5-8 work items
    - Solo work: 2-4 work items

You can always add more items if you finish early, but it's better to under-commit and over-deliver than to consistently miss deadlines.

## Track cycle progress
Once your cycle is active with work items, monitor progress regularly:

The cycle detail page shows:
Completion percentage - How much work is done
Burn-down chart - Work remaining over time
Work item breakdown - Status distribution (pending, started, completed)

Use daily check-ins
Check your cycle progress daily to:

See which work items need attention
Identify blockers or delays early
Adjust scope if needed
Celebrate completed work

Monitor team velocity
Over multiple cycles, you'll see patterns:

How much work your team can realistically complete
Which types of work take longer than expected
When to adjust cycle length or capacity


Step 6: Complete your cycle
As your cycle end date approaches:
Finish remaining work
Focus on completing work items rather than starting new ones. Move any incomplete work to the next cycle or back to the backlog.
Review what was accomplished
At cycle end, review:

Completed work items - What the team delivered
Incomplete items - What needs to carry over
Lessons learned - What worked well and what to improve

Success! You're working in focused cycles
You've created your first cycle and learned the fundamentals of time-boxed work planning. This approach helps teams deliver consistently and makes progress visible to everyone.
