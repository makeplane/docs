Introduce Workspace level Views here- you can talk about pinning it to the sidebar. 



# Organize and view your work
Now that you can create and collaborate on work items, let's learn how to organize and view them effectively. Plane provides powerful tools to help you see exactly the work that matters to you, when you need to see it.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- Switched between different layout views to match your workflow
- Used filters to find specific work items quickly
- Customized display options to see the information you need
- Created and saved a custom view for recurring use

## Explore different layouts
Layouts change how your work items are visually organized. Each layout serves different purposes:

1. In your project, look for the layout icons in the top right corner of the Work Items page.
2. Click each icon to see how your work items appear differently:

    - List - Detailed table view for scanning many items with full information
    - Board - Visual workflow cards for drag-and-drop state management and team discussions
    - Calendar- Timeline view for deadline management and scheduling
    - Table - Excel-like grid for bulk editing and data manipulation
    - Timeline - Project timeline view for dependencies and milestone tracking

Each layout shows the same work items but optimized for different tasks. Try switching between them to see which feels most natural for your current work.

## Filter work items to focus
Filters help you see only the work items relevant to your current task.

1. Click the **Filters** button in your project toolbar
2. Try these key filters:

- Assignee - Select your name to see only work assigned to you
- State - Choose "In Progress" to focus on active work needing attention
- Priority - Select "High" to see urgent items for daily prioritization
- Due date - Filter by "This week" to focus on upcoming deadlines

### Combine multiple filters
Apply several filters together for precise focus:

Your urgent work: Assignee = You + Priority = High
Team's active work: State = In Progress + multiple team members
Upcoming deadlines: Due date = This week + State ≠ Done

The work items list updates in real-time as you add or remove filters, giving you exactly the view you need for your current context.

## Customize display options
Display options control what information you see for each work item. The display options change based on your layout.

1. Click the **Display** dropdown next to Filters.

2. Toggle properties on/off to reduce visual clutter and focus on what matters right now. The available properties vary by layout.

### Organize your work items
- Group by - Cluster work items logically (by State, Assignee, Priority, or Labels)
- Order by - Sort items within groups (by Priority for planning, Due date for deadlines, or Updated date for recent activity)
- Sub-work items - Show or hide nested tasks depending on your detail needs

## Save as a custom view

Views save your perfect combination of layout, filters, and display settings so you can reuse them instantly. There are two ways to create views:

### Method 1: Save your current setup
When you've found a useful combination of filters and display settings:

1. Set up your ideal view (try Board layout + your assignee + active states only)
2. Click **Save View** in the top-right corner.
3. Give it a clear name.
3. Your view is saved with all current settings

### Method 2: Create from Views section
Start fresh by building a view from scratch:

1. Click "Views" in your project sidebar
2. Click "Add view" or the "+" button
3. Set up your layout, filters, and display options in the dialog.
4. Name your view and click "Create View"


Both methods create views that appear in your project sidebar under "Views". Click any view name to instantly apply those exact settings - layout, filters, display options, and grouping all switch automatically.

## Use Your work dashboard for personal productivity
Your work dashboard gives you a unified view of all your work across every project in your workspace:

1. In the sidebar, click **Your work** (under the workspace section).
2. This shows all your work from every project in one place
3. Each tab focuses on a different aspect of your work:
    - Summary - Your work overview with visual charts showing task distribution, priority breakdown, and recent activity
    - Assigned - All work items currently assigned to you, organized by project with priorities and due dates visible
    - Created - Work items you've originated, useful for tracking your ideas and requests regardless of who's working on them now
    - Subscribed - Work items you're following for updates without being assigned, keeping you informed on important work
    - Activity - Complete timeline of all activity on work you're involved with across all projects

### Build a daily routine
Use Your work as your starting point each morning:
Check the Summary tab for workload balance and priority distribution, then switch to Assigned to see today's specific tasks. The Activity tab catches you up on overnight updates and team progress.

This cross-project view helps you prioritize when you're working on multiple projects and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. Your work dashboard becomes your personal mission control for staying organized across your entire workspace.
