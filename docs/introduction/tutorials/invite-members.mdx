## Access Members page
There are two ways to invite team members to your workspace:

**From the workspace switcher**  

![Switcher invite members](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/switcher-invite-members.webp#hero)

1. Click on your workspace name in the top-left corner.
2. Next to your current workspace, click **Invite members**.

**From workspace settings**

1. Click your workspace name, then **Settings**.
2. In the left pane, click **Members** under **Administration**.
3. Click the **Add member** button in the top-right.
