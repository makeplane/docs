Set up your first project where your team can organize work, track progress, and collaborate effectively.

- Enable essential features for your team's workflow
- Set up workflow states that match how your team works
- Add team members and organize work with labels

## Explore the Projects section
Before creating your project, let's understand where all projects live in your workspace.

![Workspace Projects](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/workspace-projects.webp#center)

1. Look for **Projects** under the Workspace section in your sidebar.
2. You might see a few projects already there that other members may have created.
3. This is where all workspace projects are displayed.

### Understand project visibility
- Public projects show for all workspace members with the **Join** option.
- Projects you're part ofdisplay directly in your sidebar under the **Projects** section.
- Private projects are only visible if you're specifically invited.

## Create your project

Start building a space for your team's work and collaboration.

1. **Begin the creation process**
    - Click **Projects** in your workspace sidebar to view all projects.
    - Click **Add Project** button (top-right).
    - The project creation form opens.

    You can also create projects quickly using the **+** button next to the **Projects** section in your sidebar.

2. **Configure basic project information**

    ![Create project](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/create-project.webp#center)

    - **Project name**: Enter something clear and recognizable. Choose names your team will instantly understand.
    *Examples*: "Website Redesign", "Mobile App v2.0", "Q4 Marketing Campaign"

    - **Description**: Add 1-2 sentences explaining the project's purpose.  
    *Example*: "Complete redesign of company website focusing on improved user experience and modern design"

    - **Project ID**: Plane automatically suggests a Project ID based on your project name (like "WEB" for "Website Redesign"). This ID will prefix all your issues (WEB-1, WEB-2, etc.).You can customize it, but keep it short (3-5 characters).

    - **Set project access**: Keep **Public** selected for now. This allows all workspace Admins and Members to see and join the project. You can change this to **Private** later if needed.

3. **Create the project**
    - Click **Create project** to finish basic setup.
    - Youâ€™ll see a modal with all the features enabled for this project. Leave the defaults as they are and click **Open project**.
    - Your new project appears in the sidebar under the **Projects** section.

## Configure project settings
Customize your project to match how your team works. 

![Project settings](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/access-project-settings.webp#center)
1. **Access project settings**
    - Click the three dots (...) next to your project name in the sidebar.
    - Select **Settings**.
    - You'll land on the **General** tab by default.

    - **Project visibility (Network)**: Choose based on your team's collaboration needs.
        - **Public**: All workspace members can see and join the project.
        - **Private**: Only invited members can access the project.

    - **Project timezone**: Set the timezone for project scheduling and deadlines.

3. **Save your changes**
    - Click **Update project** to apply your modifications.
    - Your project now reflects the updated configuration.

Key team members are added and can access the project to start contributing.

## Set up workflow states

Workflow states define how work moves through your team's process. 

![Project states](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/project-states.webp#center)

1. **Access states configuration**
    - In project settings, click **States** in the left pane.
    - You'll see default state groups already created

2. **Understand state groups**
    - **Backlog**: For ideas and future work
    - **Unstarted**: Ready to work on but not yet started
    - **Started**: Work currently in progress
    - **Completed**: Finished work
    - **Cancelled**: Work that won't be completed

3. **Customize states for your workflow**

    - Click on any state group to see individual states inside.
    - Use the **+** button to add new states.
    - Rename states to match your team's language.
    - Reorder states to reflect your actual process.

    **Example workflows**

    *Simple development workflow*:

    - Backlog: "Backlog"
    - Unstarted: "Ready", "Assigned"
    - Started: "In Progress", "In Review"
    - Completed: "Done"

    *Design workflow*:

    - Backlog: "Ideas"
    - Unstarted: "Scheduled", "Ready for Design"
    - Started: "Designing", "Review", "Revisions"
    - Completed: "Approved"

Don't overthink this - you can always adjust states later as your team's process evolves.

## Create useful labels
Labels help categorize and organize your work. 

![Project labels](https://media.docs.plane.so/tutorials/project-labels.webp#center)

1. **Access labels configuration**
    - In project settings, click **Labels** in the sidebar.
    - You'll see any existing labels (may be empty)

2. **Create essential labels**
    - Click **Add label** to create new labels.
    - Add a few labels that match your work types
        Examples: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `API`, `design`, `documentation`, `testing`, `research`

3. **Customize label appearance**
    - Choose colors for each label to make them easily distinguishable.
