Also Introduce the Projects section under Workspaces here so they know where to view and join all projects in their worksapce.




Now that you have your workspace and team ready, let's create your first project. 

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- Created your first project with a clear purpose
- Enabled the essential features your team needs
- Set up workflow states that match how your team works
- Added team members who can contribute to the project

## Create your project

1. Look for **Projects** section on your sidebar. (You might see a sample project already).
2. Click the **+** button next to it. 
3. Select **Create project**. This opens the project creation form where you'll define your project's basic information.
4. In the project creation form:
    - Enter a clear, recognizable name that describes what this project is about. Examples: "Website Redesign", "Mobile App v2.0", "Q4 Marketing Campaign".
    - Write a brief description. Add 1-2 sentences explaining what this project aims to accomplish.
    - Plane automatically suggests a Project ID based on your project name (like "WEB" for "Website Redesign"). This ID will prefix all your issues (WEB-1, WEB-2, etc.).You can customize it, but keep it short (3-5 characters).

5. Configure project access settings. Keep the **Public** setting selected for now. This means that all workspace members (Admins and Members) can see and join this project.

6. Click **Create project** to finish the basic setup.

Congratulations! You now have a project. You'll see it appear in your sidebar with the emoji and name you chose.

## Configure essential features
Now you'll customize your project to match how your team works. 

1. Click the three dots (**...**) next to your project name in the sidebar.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. You'll see the **Features** tab on the left pane.
4. Enable the features you need and based on your team's workflow:
    - Cycles (Recommended for most teams) - Turn this ON if your team works in sprints, iterations, or time-boxed periods.
    - Modules (Recommended for larger projects) - Turn this ON if you want to group related work into features or components
    - Views (Recommended - turn ON) - Allows you to save your custom filters and display options.
    - Pages - Turn ON if you need documentation, notes, or planning pages within your project.
    - Intake - Turn ON if external people need to submit work items to your project. 

## Set up workflow states

Workflow states define how work moves through your team's process. Let's customize them:

1. In project settings, click **States** in the left pane.
2. You'll see default state groups: 
    - Backlog: For ideas and future work
    - Unstarted: Ready to work on but not yet started
    - Started: Work currently in progress
    - Completed: Finished work
    - Cancelled: Cancelled work

3. Click on any state group to see the individual states inside. You can:
    - Rename states to match your team's language.
    - Add new states using the **+** button.
    - Reorder states to match your process.

    For a simple workflow, try:

    - Backlog: "Backlog"
    - Unstarted: "Ready", "Assigned"
    - Started: "In Progress", "In Review"
    - Completed: "Done"

    For a design workflow, try:

    Backlog: "Ideas"
    Unstarted: "Scheduled", "Ready for Design"
    Started: "Designing", "Review", "Revisions"
    Completed: "Approved"

    Don't overthink this. You can always adjust states later as your team's process evolves.

## Create useful labels
Labels help categorize and organize your work. Let's create a few essential ones:

1. In project settings, click **Labels** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add label** to create new labels.

3. Create 3-5 essential labels. eg:, *frontend*, *backend* *design*. You can also choose colors for each label 

## Add team members to your project
Finally, let's add team members who will work on this project:

1. Go to Project esttings. Select **Members & Teamspaces** in the sidebar. You'll see the **Members** section at the bottom

2. Click **Add member**. 
3. Click **Select co-worker** and you'll see all your workspace members. Add 2-3 key team members who will actively contribute to this project.

:::tip[Remember]
- Workspace Admins can automatically see and join all projects (public and private)
- Workspace Members can see and join only public projects.
- Guests must be specifically invited to projects.

Success! Your project is ready.
