# Comment on work items

Keep the conversation flowing on any work item with our built-in commenting system. Whether you need to ask a quick question, provide feedback, or share an update, simply scroll down to the comment section and start typing.

Tag teammates for instant notifications. Just use the @ symbol followed by a team member's name, and they'll get an email notification so nothing slips through the cracks. It's perfect for when you need someone's input or want to loop them into the discussion.

Full editing control - Made a typo or want to add more context? No problem. You can edit your comments anytime to keep things clear and accurate. And if you ever need to remove a comment entirely, the delete option is always there. You can also copy a direct link to any comment. Just click the three dots on any comment and select **Copy link** to share that specific part of the conversation with others.

The rich text editor gives you all the formatting tools you need - bold text for emphasis, bullet points for clarity, or even code snippets when you're discussing technical details. It's like having a mini word processor right in your work item, making it easy to communicate exactly what you mean.

## Track work item activity

Inside each work item, youâ€™ll find an Activity log tracking updates like status changes, reassignments, or due date modifications. This feed also logs comments, which support rich formatting for discussions, updates, or sharing resources related to the work item.

You can filter the activity log to display specific types of acticity, such as comments, updates, or [worklogs](/core-concepts/issues/time-tracking). Additionally, you can sort the log by activity date in either ascending or descending order.
