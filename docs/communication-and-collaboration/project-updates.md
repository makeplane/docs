# Share project status with Project Updates

Project updates provide a way to share project status and create a timeline of project progress. Use updates to communicate where your project stands, highlight blockers, and keep stakeholders informed without requiring meetings or status check-ins.

**What are project updates**  
Updates are status posts that appear in your project's side panel. Each update includes a status indicator (On Track, At Risk, or Off Track) and a message describing the current state of the project. Updates appear in chronological order, creating a history of your project's progress over time.

**When to use project updates**

- Regular status reporting (weekly sprints, monthly milestones)
- Communicating blockers or risks to stakeholders
- Keeping remote or distributed teams aligned
- Creating a historical record of project decisions and progress
- Providing visibility to team members who aren't in daily standups

Project updates must be enabled in project settings.

### Project status options

Each update requires a status indicator that signals the project's current state:

**🚀 On Track**  
The project is progressing as planned. Work is moving forward according to schedule, no significant blockers exist, and the team is meeting milestones as expected. Use this status for regular positive progress updates.

**⚠️ At Risk**  
The project has potential issues that need attention. There may be emerging blockers, resource concerns, or dependencies that could impact timelines if not addressed. Use this status to flag concerns early and request help before issues become critical.

**❗ Off Track**  
The project has significant blockers or delays. Critical issues are preventing progress, timelines are at risk, or major decisions are needed to get back on track. Use this status when immediate action or escalation is required.

## Collaborate on updates

Project updates support threaded discussions and reactions, allowing team members to engage with status updates directly.

**Start discussions**

- Add comments in the thread below the update.
- Use threads to discuss specific points, ask questions, or provide additional context.
- Threaded discussions keep conversations organized and connected to the relevant update.

**Use emoji reactions**

- React to updates with emojis for quick feedback.
- Reactions provide lightweight acknowledgment without requiring a full comment.

**Mention team members** _(Coming soon)_

- Tag specific team members in update comments to notify them directly.
- Use mentions to request input, escalate issues, or delegate follow-up actions.
