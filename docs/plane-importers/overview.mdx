Plane's importers simplify the process of migrating project data from other tools. Instead of manually recreating your project structure and history, you can transfer existing issues, workflows, and project details directly into Plane.

Switching tools shouldn’t mean starting over. With Plane importers, you can effortlessly migrate your data, preserving your team’s progress and ensuring a smooth transition.
