    2. For **How do you want to record issue types in Plane?**, choose an option to define how issue types in Jira should be imported to your Plane project.
        - **Create as a label** - Imports issue types in Jira as [Labels](https://docs.plane.so/core-concepts/projects/run-project#manage-labels) in Plane.
        - **Add [ issue_type ] in the title** - Prefixes the issue type to the Issue title in Plane.   
        *Example*: **[TASK] Blitz with dev team** where **TASK** is an issue type in Jira.
