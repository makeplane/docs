# Contributing to Plane documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plane documentation! We're thrilled to have you here, and we're eager to work together to make this project better.

## Report issues

If you encounter any issues with our documentation or have suggestions for improvements, we encourage you to follow these steps:

1. **Check existing issues**: Before raising a new issue, please verify if a similar issue already exists.
2. **Create an issue**: If you don't find an existing issue that matches your concern, feel free to create a new one. Provide as much detail as possible to clearly explain the problem or enhancement you're proposing.

## Set up your development environment

To get started with the development environment, please refer to our [README.md](/README.md). It contains all the necessary instructions to set up your environment and dependencies.

## How to submit changes

We follow a simple and structured process for submitting changes.

1. Checkout the `preview` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout preview
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes:

   ```bash
   git pull origin preview
   ```

3. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

4. Make necessary changes in the code editor of your choice.

5. Commit your changes. Leave a clear and concise message that links to the corresponding issue (if applicable) and explains the fix or enhancement you've made.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixes #<issue-number>: Description of the fix or enhancement"
   ```

6. Push the changes.

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

7. Raise a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the **preview** branch. Please provide a detailed description of your changes.

8. Before we can merge your contribution, you must sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This agreement ensures that your contributions comply with our licensing terms.

After you submit your PR, a member of the Plane team will review it. Depending on our workload, response times may vary, but we'll do our best to get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!
