Plane is still in its early days, not everything will be perfect yet, and
hiccups may happen. Please let us know of any suggestions, ideas, or bugs that
you encounter on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge).

# Install with Docker

> It is strongly advised that you install the latest version of Docker available.
> Please check that your docker is up-to date by running docker -v.

This guide assumes you already have Docker installed and have permissions to run Docker containers. See the [Install on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for an installation from scratch.

## Quick Start

Run the command below to start a Plane server running locally listening on port `80`.
You will only be able to connect to Plane from the machine running the server via
`http://localhost/`.

```
docker run -d --name plane -e NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost -e DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=plane.settings.production -p 80:80 --restart unless-stopped makeplane/plane:0.2.1
```

- Add `-e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pwd@host:port/db` to use an external
  Postgresql.
- Add `-e REDIS_URL=redis://user:pwd@host:port` to use an external Redis.

## Image Feature Overview

The `plane:0.2.1` image by default runs all of Plane's various services in a
single container for ease of use. A quick summary of its features are:

- Set `DATABASE_URL` or the `DATABASE_...` variables to connect to an external Postgres.
- Set `REDIS_URL` or the `REDIS_...` variables to connect to an external Postgres.
- Runs all services behind a pre-configured nginx reverse proxy.

## Upgrading from a previous version

- It is recommended that you backup your data before upgrading, see the Backup sections
  below for more details on how to do this.

- Stop your existing plane container:

```
docker stop plane
```

- Bump the image version in the `docker run` command you usually use to run your
  plane and start up a brand-new container:

```
# We haven't yet deleted the old plane container so you need to start this new one
# with a different name to prevent an error like:
# `response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/plane" is already in use by
# container`

docker run \\
  -d \\
  --name plane_version_REPLACE_WITH_NEW_VERSION \\
  # YOUR STANDARD ARGS HERE
  makeplane/plane:REPLACE_WITH_LATEST_VERSION

```

- Plane will automatically upgrade itself on startup, follow the logs to monitor it:

```
docker logs -f plane_version_REPLACE_WITH_NEW_VERSION
```

- Make sure your Plane has been successfully upgraded by visiting it and checking
  everything is working as expected and your data is still present.
- If everything works you can now remove the old Plane container.

```
docker rm plane
```
