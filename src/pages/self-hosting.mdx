# Self Hosting Plane

import { Heading } from '@/components/Heading'

Plane is still in its early days, not everything is perfect yet, and
hiccups may happen. Please let us know of any suggestions, ideas, or bugs that
you encounter on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/A92xrEGCge).

This guide assumes you already have Docker installed
and have permissions to run Docker containers.
See the [Install on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
guide which explains installing Docker on your machine.

## Install with Docker Compose (recommended way)

### Clone the Repository and change the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makeplane/plane && cd plane
```

### Run setup.sh

This script downloads all the required dependencies,
and sets up the environment with the IP address you provided.

```bash
./setup.sh <your_ip>
```

<Note>
`<your_ip>` is a placeholder for the actual IP address
that you'd want your Plane instance to be available on.

If you are setting Plane up, for example, on your own PC,
it is recommended to use `localhost` for the IP address.
</Note>

### Bootstrap Plane with Docker Compose

```bash
# -d detaches the containers, allowing you to perform other commands from the same shell
# and allowing you to disconnect from the SSH server.
# If you do not want for the containers to run in the background,
# remove the flag.
docker-compose up -d
```

### Log in and enjoy your new and shiny Plane instance!
  
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/` to login onto your Plane instance.
  
There is a default user: `captain@plane.so` with the password `password123`.
