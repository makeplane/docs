# Integrations (WIP)

Plane's integrations make it easy for users to connect their Workspace and
projects to popular third-party tools. This enables seamless management of
issues and notifications, all from within the Plane platform.

Rather than
having to switch back and forth between different tools and interfaces, users
can access and manage their third-party tools directly from within the Plane
platform. This streamlines workflows and improves efficiency by providing a
centralized hub for all project-related activities.

## GitHub Sync

GitHub Sync allows users to connect any GitHub repository to a Plane project,
enabling cross-synchronization of issues between Plane and GitHub in both
directions.

By connecting a GitHub repository to a Plane project, users can easily track
issues and changes in both platforms. This allows for a more streamlined
workflow, as users can manage their GitHub issues and pull requests from
within the Plane platform.

The bi-directional synchronization means that changes made in either platform
will be reflected in the other. For example, if a user creates a new issue in
Plane, it will automatically be synced with the corresponding repository in
GitHub. Similarly, if a user closes an issue in GitHub, it will be reflected
in Plane as well.

<Note>
  Plane is still in development, if there are any hiccups in
  Integrations, please report them to us on our [Discord server]() or [Github issues]().

### Plane to Github Synchronization Overivew

### Configure GitHub Integration

**1.** Install and authenticate GitHub Sync
<Note>
  Obviously, GitHub Sync requires you to authenticate with your account
  to add the Plane GitHub application.
  Also, if you want to use GitHub Sync in an organization, you may need to
  ask an admin to allow Plane to access the organization, or do that yourself:
  Organization settings => GitHub Apps (*enter sudo mode*) => approve the request for the Plane integration.
