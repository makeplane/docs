Plane's integrations make it easy for users to connect their Workspace and
projects to popular third-party tools. This enables seamless management of
issues and notifications, all from within the Plane platform.

Rather than having to switch back and forth between different tools and interfaces, users
can access and manage their third-party tools directly from within the Plane
platform. This streamlines workflows and improves efficiency by providing a
centralized hub for all project-related activities.
