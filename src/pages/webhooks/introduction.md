A webhook triggers a HTTP POST request on the specified url, whenever there is a change in an event. Like a new project is created, updated or deleted then a webhook can be triggered to receive the required payload.

## Creating a webhook

`url` You are required to provide a url in which you want the payloads to be triggered.

Then select the events for which you want the webhook to be triggered.

After you create the webhook, a secret key will be created automatically and will be downloaded in csv format.

### Webhook Header

```
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"User-Agent": "Autopilot",
"X-Plane-Delivery": "f819eff4-cd50-4987-bc97-e5be1e04c94f",
"X-Plane-Event": "project",
"X-Plane-Signature": "7896ae9addb1f73931132b4f3e052bf12c410b837b24898e75dcd660c7"
```

| Header            | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-Plane-Delivery  | It is a randomly generated UUID for uniquely identifying the payload |
| X-Plane-Event     | It describes the event for which the webhook triggered               |
| X-Plane-Signature | A signature is generated based on the secret and the payload         |

### Webhook Payload Example for the project `update`

```
"event": "project",
"action": "update",
"webhook_id": "3c2c32ac-82df-48b3-be2a-a3e21dbe8692",

    },

},
```

User can choose the things for which they want the webhook to be triggered.

Currently Plane supports the following events for which webhook can be trigged:

- Project
- Issue
- Cycle
- Module
- Issue Comment

## Verifying Signature

```
import hashlib
import hmac

secret_token = os.environ.get("WEBHOOK_SECRET")

received_signature = request.headers.get('X-Plane-Signature')
received_payload = json.dumps(request.json).encode('utf-8')

expected_signature = hmac.new(secret_token.encode('utf-8'), msg=received_payload, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, received_signature):
   raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid Signature provided")
```

## How webhook works

Your webhook consumer is a simple HTTP endpoint. It must satisfy the following conditions:

- It's available in a publicly accessible non-localhost URL.
- It will respond to the Plane Webhook push (HTTP POST request) with a `HTTP 200` ("OK") response.

If a delivery fails (i.e. server unavailable or responded with a non-200 HTTP status code), the push will be retried a couple of times. Here an exponential backoff delay is used: the attempt will be retried after approximately 10 minutes, then 30 minutes, and so on. 

The webhooks are triggered for POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. 

- For DELETE requests, the response only includes the ID of the deleted entity.

```
"action":"delete",
"data":{
	"id":"9a28bd00-ed9c-4f5d-8be9-fc05cbb1fc57"
},
"event":"issue",
"webhook_id":"f1a2fe64-c8d4-4eed-b3ef-498690052c1d",
"workspace_id":"c467e125-59e3-44ec-b5ee-f9c1e138c611"
```

- However, for both POST and PATCH requests, the complete payload is sent in the response.

```
"event":"issue",
"action":"update",
"webhook_id":"f1a2fe64-c8d4-4eed-b3ef-498690052c1d",
"workspace_id":"c467e125-59e3-44ec-b5ee-f9c1e138c611",
"data":{ ... }
```

Note:- Whenever an issue is added to the module, the corresponding issue webhook will be triggered. Similarly, any updates made to the cycle issue will also activate the issue webhook.
