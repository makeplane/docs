## Pre-requisite

- A Plane One license
<Tip> If you don’t have a license, get it [here](https://prime.plane.so/)  </Tip>
- A working Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` and `helm` on the client system that you will use to install our Helm charts

## Installing Plane One

1. Open Terminal or any other command-line app that has access to Kubernetes tools on your local system.
2. Set the following environment variables.

    Copy the format of constants below, paste it on Terminal to start setting environment variables, set values for each variable, and hit ENTER or RETURN.
    <Tip> You will get the values for the variables from [prime.plane.so](https://prime.plane.so) under the Kuberntes tab of your license's details page. When installing Plane One for the first time, remember to specify a domain name.</Tip>

    ```bash
    LICENSE_KEY=<your_license_key>
    REG_USER_ID=<license-XXXXX+XXXX-XXXX-XXX-XXXXX>
    REG_PASSWORD=<******>
    PLANE_VERSION=<v1.xx.x>
    DOMAIN_NAME=<subdomain.domain.tld or domain.tld>
    ```

3. Add Plane helm chart repo

    Continue to be on the same Terminal window as with the previous steps, copy the code below, paste it on Terminal, and hit ENTER or RETURN.

    ```bash
    helm repo add plane https://helm.plane.so/
    helm repo update
    ```

4. Set-up and customization
    - Quick set-up

        This is the fastest way to deploy Plane with default settings. This will create stateful deployments for Postgres, Redis, and Minio with a persistent volume claim using the `longhorn` storage class. This also sets up the ingress routes for you using `nginx` ingress class.
        <Tip> To customize this, see `Custom ingress routes` below.</Tip>

        Continue to be on the same Terminal window as you have so far, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

        ```bash
        helm install one-app plane/plane-enterprise \
            --create-namespace \
            --namespace plane-one \
            --set dockerRegistry.loginid=${REG_USER_ID} \
            --set dockerRegistry.password=${REG_PASSWORD} \
            --set license.licenseKey=${LICENSE_KEY} \
            --set license.licenseDomain=${DOMAIN_NAME} \
            --set license.licenseServer=https://prime.plane.so \
            --set planeVersion=${PLANE_VERSION} \
            --set ingress.ingressClass=nginx \
            --set env.storageClass=longhorn \
            --timeout 10m \
            --wait \
            --wait-for-jobs
        ```

        <Tip>  
        This is the minimum required to set up Plane One. You can change the default namespace from `plane-one`, the default appname
        from `one-app`, the default storage class from `env.storageClass`, and the default ingress class from `ingress.ingressClass` to 
        whatever you would like to.

        You can also pass other settings referring to `Configuration Settings` section.
        </Tip>
    - Advance set-up

        For more control over your set-up, run the script below to download the `values.yaml` file and and edit using any editor like Vim or Nano. 

        ```bash
        helm  show values plane/plane-enterprise > values.yaml
        vi values.yaml
        ```

        Make sure you set the minimum required values as below.
        - `planeVersion: <v1.xx.x>`
        - `dockerRegistry.loginid: <REG_USER_ID as on prime.plane.so>`
        - `dockerRegistry.password: <REG_PASSWORD as on prime.plane.so>`
        - `license.licenseKey: <LICENSE_KEY as on prime.plane.so>`
        - `license.licenseDomain: <The domain you have specified to host Plane>`
        - `license.licenseServer: https://prime.plane.so`
        - `ingress.ingressClass: <nginx or any other ingress class configured in your cluster>`
        - `env.storageClass: <longhorn or any other storage class configured in your cluster>`

        <Tip> See `Available customizations` for more details.</Tip>

        After saving the `values.yaml` file, continue to be on the same Terminal window as on the previous steps, copy the code below, and paste it on your Terminal screen.

        ```bash
        helm install one-app plane/plane-enterprise \
            --create-namespace \
            --namespace plane-one \
            -f values.yaml \
            --timeout 10m \
            --wait \
            --wait-for-jobs 
        ```

### Ingress and SSL Setup

| Setting | Default | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| ingress.enabled | true |  | Ingress setup in kubernetes is a common practice to expose application to the intended audience.  Set it to `false` if you are using external ingress providers like `Cloudflare` |
| ingress.minioHost | 'plane-services.minio.example.com' |  | Based on above configuration, if you want to expose the `minio` web console to set of users, use this key to set the `host` mapping or leave it as `EMPTY` to not expose interface. |
| ingress.ingressClass | 'nginx' | Yes | Kubernetes cluster setup comes with various options of `ingressClass`. Based on your setup, set this value to the right one (eg. nginx, traefik, etc). Leave it to default in case you are using external ingress provider.|
| ingress.ingress_annotations | `{ "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size": "5m" }` |  | Ingress controllers comes with various configuration options which can be passed as annotations. Setting this value lets you change the default value to user required. |
| ssl.createIssuer | false |  | Kubernets cluster setup supports creating `issuer` type resource. After deployment, this is step towards creating secure access to the ingress url. Issuer is required for you generate SSL certifiate. Kubernetes can be configured to use any of the certificate authority to generate SSL (depending on CertManager configuration). Set it to `true` to create the issuer. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true`|
| ssl.issuer | http |  | CertManager configuration allows user to create issuers using `http` or any of the other DNS Providers like `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`, etc. As of now Plane supports `http`, `cloudflare`, `digitalocean`|
| ssl.token |  |  | To create issuers using DNS challenge, set the issuer api token of dns provider like cloudflare` or `digitalocean`(not required for http) |
| ssl.server | [https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory](https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory) |  | Issuer creation configuration need the certificate generation authority server url. Default URL is the `Let's Encrypt` server|
| ssl.email | [plane@example.com](plane@example.com) |  | Certificate generation authority needs a valid email id before generating certificate. Required when `ssl.createIssuer=true`  |
| ssl.generateCerts | false |  | After creating the issuers, user can still not create the certificate untill sure of configuration. Setting this to `true` will try to generate SSL certificate and associate with ingress. Applicable only when `ingress.enabled=true` and `ssl.createIssuer=true` |

### Common Environment Settings

| Setting | Default | Required | Description |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| env.storageClass | longhorn |  | Creating the persitant volumes for the stateful deployments needs the `storageClass` name. Set the correct value as per your kubernetes cluster configuration. |
| env.secret_key | 60gp0byfz2dvffa45cxl20p1scy9xbpf6d8c5y0geejgkyp1b5 | Yes | This must a random string which is used for hashing/encrypting the sensitive data within the application. Once set, changing this might impact the already hashed/encrypted data|

## Custom Ingress Routes
